        <h2>Bee Movie</h2>
    <p>According to all known laws
        of aviation,
        
        
        there is no way a bee
        should be able to fly.
        
        
        Its wings are too small to get
        its fat little body off the ground.
        
        
        The bee, of course, flies anyway
        
        
        because bees don't care
        what humans think is impossible.
        
        
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
        
        
        Ooh, black and yellow!
        Let's shake it up a little.
        
        Barry! Breakfast is ready!
        
        
        Coming!
        
        
        Hang on a second.
        
        
        Hello?
        
        
        - Barry?
        - Adam?
        
        
        - Can you believe this is happening?
        - I can't. I'll pick you up.
        
        
        Looking sharp.
        
        
        Use the stairs. Your father
        paid good money for those.
        
        Sorry. I'm excited.
        
        
        Here's the graduate.
        We're very proud of you, son.
        
        
        A perfect report card, all B's.
        
        
        Very proud.
        
        
        Ma! I got a thing going here.
        
        
        - You got lint on your fuzz.
        - Ow! That's me!
        
        
        - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
        - Bye!
        
        
        Barry, I told you,
        stop flying in the house!
        
        - Hey, Adam.
        - Hey, Barry.
        
        
        - Is that fuzz gel?
        - A little. Special day, graduation.
        
        
        Never thought I'd make it.
        
        
        Three days grade school,
        three days high school.
        
        
        Those were awkward.
        
        
        Three days college. I'm glad I took
        a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
        
        
        You did come back different.
        
        
        - Hi, Barry.
        - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
        
        
        - Hear about Frankie?
        - Yeah.
        
        
        - You going to the funeral?
        - No, I'm not going.
        
        
        Everybody knows,
        sting someone, you die.
        
        
        Don't waste it on a squirrel.
        Such a hothead.
        
        
        I guess he could have
        just gotten out of the way.
        
        
        I love this incorporating
        an amusement park into our day.
        
        
        That's why we don't need vacations.
        
        
        Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
        under the circumstances.
        
        
        - Well, Adam, today we are men.
        - We are!
        
        
        - Bee-men.
        - Amen!
        
        
        Hallelujah!
        
        
        Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
        
        
        please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
        
        
        Welcome, New Hive Oity
        graduating class of...
        
        
        ...9:15.
        
        
        That concludes our ceremonies.
        
        
        And begins your career
        at Honex Industries!
        
        
        Will we pick our job today?
        
        
        I heard it's just orientation.
        
        
        Heads up! Here we go.
        
        
        Keep your hands and antennas
        inside the tram at all times.
        
        
        - Wonder what it'll be like?
        - A little scary.
        
        
        Welcome to Honex,
        a division of Honesco
        
        
        and a part of the Hexagon Group.
        
        
        This is it!
        
        
        Wow.
        
        
        Wow.
        
        
        We know that you, as a bee,
        have worked your whole life
        
        
        to get to the point where you
        can work for your whole life.
        
        
        Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
        Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
        
        
        Our top-secret formula
        
        
        is automatically color-corrected,
        scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
        
        
        into this soothing sweet syrup
        
        
        with its distinctive
        golden glow you know as...
        
        
        Honey!
        
        
        - That girl was hot.
        - She's my cousin!
        
        
        - She is?
        - Yes, we're all cousins.
        
        
        - Right. You're right.
        - At Honex, we constantly strive
        
        
        to improve every aspect
        of bee existence.
        
        
        These bees are stress-testing
        a new helmet technology.
        
        
        - What do you think he makes?
        - Not enough.
        
        
        Here we have our latest advancement,
        the Krelman.
        
        
        - What does that do?
        - Catches that little strand of honey
        
        
        that hangs after you pour it.
        Saves us millions.
        
        
        Can anyone work on the Krelman?
        
        
        Of course. Most bee jobs are
        small ones. But bees know
        
        
        that every small job,
        if it's done well, means a lot.
        
        
        But choose carefully
        
        
        because you'll stay in the job
        you pick for the rest of your life.
        
        
        The same job the rest of your life?
        I didn't know that.
        
        
        What's the difference?
        
        
        You'll be happy to know that bees,
        as a species, haven't had one day off
        
        
        in 27 million years.
        
        
        So you'll just work us to death?
        
        
        We'll sure try.
        
        
        Wow! That blew my mind!
        
        
        "What's the difference?"
        How can you say that?
        
        
        One job forever?
        That's an insane choice to have to make.
        
        
        I'm relieved. Now we only have
        to make one decision in life.
        
        
        But, Adam, how could they
        never have told us that?
        
        
        Why would you question anything?
        We're bees.
        
        
        We're the most perfectly
        functioning society on Earth.
        
        
        You ever think maybe things
        work a little too well here?
        
        
        Like what? Give me one example.
        
        
        I don't know. But you know
        what I'm talking about.
        
        
        Please clear the gate.
        Royal Nectar Force on approach.
        
        
        Wait a second. Oheck it out.
        
        
        - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
        - Wow.
        
        
        I've never seen them this close.
        
        
        They know what it's like
        outside the hive.
        
        
        Yeah, but some don't come back.
        
        
        - Hey, Jocks!
        - Hi, Jocks!
        
        
        You guys did great!
        
        
        You're monsters!
        You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
        
        
        - I wonder where they were.
        - I don't know.
        
        
        Their day's not planned.
        
        
        Outside the hive, flying who knows
        where, doing who knows what.
        
        
        You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
        Jock. You have to be bred for that.
        
        
        Right.
        
        
        Look. That's more pollen
        than you and I will see in a lifetime.
        
        
        It's just a status symbol.
        Bees make too much of it.
        
        
        Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
        and the ladies see you wearing it.
        
        
        Those ladies?
        Aren't they our cousins too?
        
        
        Distant. Distant.
        
        
        Look at these two.
        
        
        - Oouple of Hive Harrys.
        - Let's have fun with them.
        
        
        It must be dangerous
        being a Pollen Jock.
        
        
        Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
        against a mushroom!
        
        
        He had a paw on my throat,
        and with the other, he was slapping me!
        
        
        - Oh, my!
        - I never thought I'd knock him out.
        
        
        What were you doing during this?
        
        
        Trying to alert the authorities.
        
        
        I can autograph that.
        
        
        A little gusty out there today,
        wasn't it, comrades?
        
        
        Yeah. Gusty.
        
        
        We're hitting a sunflower patch
        six miles from here tomorrow.
        
        
        - Six miles, huh?
        - Barry!
        
        
        A puddle jump for us,
        but maybe you're not up for it.
        
        
        - Maybe I am.
        - You are not!
        
        
        We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
        
        
        What do you think, buzzy-boy?
        Are you bee enough?
        
        
        I might be. It all depends
        on what 0900 means.
        
        
        Hey, Honex!
        
        
        Dad, you surprised me.
        
        
        You decide what you're interested in?
        
        
        - Well, there's a lot of choices.
        - But you only get one.
        
        
        Do you ever get bored
        doing the same job every day?
        
        
        Son, let me tell you about stirring.
        
        
        You grab that stick, and you just
        move it around, and you stir it around.
        
        
        You get yourself into a rhythm.
        It's a beautiful thing.
        
        
        You know, Dad,
        the more I think about it,
        
        
        maybe the honey field
        just isn't right for me.
        
        
        You were thinking of what,
        making balloon animals?
        
        
        That's a bad job
        for a guy with a stinger.
        
        
        Janet, your son's not sure
        he wants to go into honey!
        
        
        - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
        - I'm not trying to be funny.
        
        
        You're not funny! You're going
        into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
        
        
        - You're gonna be a stirrer?
        - No one's listening to me!
        
        
        Wait till you see the sticks I have.
        
        
        I could say anything right now.
        I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
        
        
        Let's open some honey and celebrate!
        
        
        Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
        Shave my antennae.
        
        
        Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
        a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
        
        
        I'm so proud.
        
        
        - We're starting work today!
        - Today's the day.
        
        
        Oome on! All the good jobs
        will be gone.
        
        
        Yeah, right.
        
        
        Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
        stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
        
        
        - Is it still available?
        - Hang on. Two left!
        
        
        One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
        Step to the side.
        
        
        - What'd you get?
        - Picking crud out. Stellar!
        
        
        Wow!
        
        
        Oouple of newbies?
        
        
        Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
        
        
        Make your choice.
        
        
        - You want to go first?
        - No, you go.
        
        
        Oh, my. What's available?
        
        
        Restroom attendant's open,
        not for the reason you think.
        
        
        - Any chance of getting the Krelman?
        - Sure, you're on.
        
        
        I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
        
        
        Wax monkey's always open.
        
        
        The Krelman opened up again.
        
        
        What happened?
        
        
        A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
        He's dead. Another dead one.
        
        
        Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
        
        
        Dead from the neck up.
        Dead from the neck down. That's life!
        
        
        Oh, this is so hard!
        
        
        Heating, cooling,
        stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
        
        
        humming, inspector number seven,
        lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
        
        
        mite wrangler. Barry, what
        do you think I should... Barry?
        
        
        Barry!
        
        
        All right, we've got the sunflower patch
        in quadrant nine...
        
        
        What happened to you?
        Where are you?
        
        
        - I'm going out.
        - Out? Out where?
        
        
        - Out there.
        - Oh, no!
        
        
        I have to, before I go
        to work for the rest of my life.
        
        
        You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
        
        
        Another call coming in.
        
        
        If anyone's feeling brave,
        there's a Korean deli on 83rd
        
        
        that gets their roses today.
        
        
        Hey, guys.
        
        
        - Look at that.
        - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
        
        
        Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
        
        
        It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
        
        
        Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
        
        
        Sign here, here. Just initial that.
        
        
        - Thank you.
        - OK.
        
        
        You got a rain advisory today,
        
        
        and as you all know,
        bees cannot fly in rain.
        
        
        So be careful. As always,
        watch your brooms,
        
        
        hockey sticks, dogs,
        birds, bears and bats.
        
        
        Also, I got a couple of reports
        of root beer being poured on us.
        
        
        Murphy's in a home because of it,
        babbling like a cicada!
        
        
        - That's awful.
        - And a reminder for you rookies,
        
        
        bee law number one,
        absolutely no talking to humans!
        
        
        All right, launch positions!
        
        
        Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
        buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
        
        
        Black and yellow!
        
        
        Hello!
        
        
        You ready for this, hot shot?
        
        
        Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
        
        
        Wind, check.
        
        
        - Antennae, check.
        - Nectar pack, check.
        
        
        - Wings, check.
        - Stinger, check.
        
        
        Scared out of my shorts, check.
        
        
        OK, ladies,
        
        
        let's move it out!
        
        
        Pound those petunias,
        you striped stem-suckers!
        
        
        All of you, drain those flowers!
        
        
        Wow! I'm out!
        
        
        I can't believe I'm out!
        
        
        So blue.
        
        
        I feel so fast and free!
        
        
        Box kite!
        
        
        Wow!
        
        
        Flowers!
        
        
        This is Blue Leader.
        We have roses visual.
        
        
        Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
        
        
        Roses!
        
        
        30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
        
        
        Stand to the side, kid.
        It's got a bit of a kick.
        
        
        That is one nectar collector!
        
        
        - Ever see pollination up close?
        - No, sir.
        
        
        I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
        over here. Maybe a dash over there,
        
        
        a pinch on that one.
        See that? It's a little bit of magic.
        
        
        That's amazing. Why do we do that?
        
        
        That's pollen power. More pollen, more
        flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
        
        
        Oool.
        
        
        I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
        Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?
        
        
        Oopy that visual.
        
        
        Wait. One of these flowers
        seems to be on the move.
        
        
        Say again? You're reporting
        a moving flower?
        
        
        Affirmative.
        
        
        That was on the line!
        
        
        This is the coolest. What is it?
        
        
        I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
        
        
        It smells good.
        Not like a flower, but I like it.
        
        
        Yeah, fuzzy.
        
        
        Ohemical-y.
        
        
        Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
        
        
        My sweet lord of bees!
        
        
        Candy-brain, get off there!
        
        
        Problem!
        
        
        - Guys!
        - This could be bad.
        
        
        Affirmative.
        
        
        Very close.
        
        
        Gonna hurt.
        
        
        Mama's little boy.
        
        
        You are way out of position, rookie!
        
        
        Ooming in at you like a missile!
        
        
        Help me!
        
        
        I don't think these are flowers.
        
        
        - Should we tell him?
        - I think he knows.
        
        
        What is this?!
        
        
        Match point!
        
        
        You can start packing up, honey,
        because you're about to eat it!
        
        
        Yowser!
        
        
        Gross.
        
        
        There's a bee in the car!
        
        
        - Do something!
        - I'm driving!
        
        
        - Hi, bee.
        - He's back here!
        
        
        He's going to sting me!
        
        
        Nobody move. If you don't move,
        he won't sting you. Freeze!
        
        
        He blinked!
        
        
        Spray him, Granny!
        
        
        What are you doing?!
        
        
        Wow... the tension level
        out here is unbelievable.
        
        
        I gotta get home.
        
        
        Can't fly in rain.
        
        
        Can't fly in rain.
        
        
        Can't fly in rain.
        
        
        Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
        
        
        Ken, could you close
        the window please?
        
        
        Ken, could you close
        the window please?
        
        
        Check out my new resume.
        I made it into a fold-out brochure.
        
        
        You see? Folds out.
        
        
        Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
        
        
        What was that?
        
        
        Maybe this time. This time. This time.
        This time! This time! This...
        
        
        Drapes!
        
        
        That is diabolical.
        
        
        It's fantastic. It's got all my special
        skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
        
        
        What's number one? Star Wars?
        
        
        Nah, I don't go for that...
        
        
        ...kind of stuff.
        
        
        No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
        They're out of their minds.
        
        
        When I leave a job interview, they're
        flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
        
        
        There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
        
        
        I don't remember the sun
        having a big 75 on it.
        
        
        I predicted global warming.
        
        
        I could feel it getting hotter.
        At first I thought it was just me.
        
        
        Wait! Stop! Bee!
        
        
        Stand back. These are winter boots.
        
        
        Wait!
        
        
        Don't kill him!
        
        
        You know I'm allergic to them!
        This thing could kill me!
        
        
        Why does his life have
        less value than yours?
        
        
        Why does his life have any less value
        than mine? Is that your statement?
        
        
        I'm just saying all life has value. You
        don't know what he's capable of feeling.
        
        
        My brochure!
        
        
        There you go, little guy.
        
        
        I'm not scared of him.
        It's an allergic thing.
        
        
        Put that on your resume brochure.
        
        
        My whole face could puff up.
        
        
        Make it one of your special skills.
        
        
        Knocking someone out
        is also a special skill.
        
        
        Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
        
        
        - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
        - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
        
        
        - You could put carob chips on there.
        - Bye.
        
        
        - Supposed to be less calories.
        - Bye.
        
        
        I gotta say something.
        
        
        She saved my life.
        I gotta say something.
        
        
        All right, here it goes.
        
        
        Nah.
        
        
        What would I say?
        
        
        I could really get in trouble.
        
        
        It's a bee law.
        You're not supposed to talk to a human.
        
        
        I can't believe I'm doing this.
        
        
        I've got to.
        
        
        Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!
        
        
        No. Yes. No.
        
        
        Do it. I can't.
        
        
        How should I start it?
        "You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
        
        
        Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
        
        
        Hi!
        
        
        I'm sorry.
        
        
        - You're talking.
        - Yes, I know.
        
        
        You're talking!
        
        
        I'm so sorry.
        
        
        No, it's OK. It's fine.
        I know I'm dreaming.
        
        
        But I don't recall going to bed.
        
        
        Well, I'm sure this
        is very disconcerting.
        
        
        This is a bit of a surprise to me.
        I mean, you're a bee!
        
        
        I am. And I'm not supposed
        to be doing this,
        
        
        but they were all trying to kill me.
        
        
        And if it wasn't for you...
        
        
        I had to thank you.
        It's just how I was raised.
        
        
        That was a little weird.
        
        
        - I'm talking with a bee.
        - Yeah.
        
        
        I'm talking to a bee.
        And the bee is talking to me!
        
        
        I just want to say I'm grateful.
        I'll leave now.
        
        
        - Wait! How did you learn to do that?
        - What?
        
        
        The talking thing.
        
        
        Same way you did, I guess.
        "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
        
        
        - That's very funny.
        - Yeah.
        
        
        Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
        we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
        
        
        Anyway...
        
        
        Can I...
        
        
        ...get you something?
        - Like what?
        
        
        I don't know. I mean...
        I don't know. Ooffee?
        
        
        I don't want to put you out.
        
        
        It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
        
        
        - It's just coffee.
        - I hate to impose.
        
        
        - Don't be ridiculous!
        - Actually, I would love a cup.
        
        
        Hey, you want rum cake?
        
        
        - I shouldn't.
        - Have some.
        
        
        - No, I can't.
        - Oome on!
        
        
        I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
        
        
        - Where?
        - These stripes don't help.
        
        
        You look great!
        
        
        I don't know if you know
        anything about fashion.
        
        
        Are you all right?
        
        
        No.
        
        
        He's making the tie in the cab
        as they're flying up Madison.
        
        
        He finally gets there.
        
        
        He runs up the steps into the church.
        The wedding is on.
        
        
        And he says, "Watermelon?
        I thought you said Guatemalan.
        
        
        Why would I marry a watermelon?"
        
        
        Is that a bee joke?
        
        
        That's the kind of stuff we do.
        
        
        Yeah, different.
        
        
        So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
        
        
        About work? I don't know.
        
        
        I want to do my part for the hive,
        but I can't do it the way they want.
        
        
        I know how you feel.
        
        
        - You do?
        - Sure.
        
        
        My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
        a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
        
        
        - Really?
        - My only interest is flowers.
        
        
        Our new queen was just elected
        with that same campaign slogan.
        
        
        Anyway, if you look...
        
        
        There's my hive right there. See it?
        
        
        You're in Sheep Meadow!
        
        
        Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
        
        
        No way! I know that area.
        I lost a toe ring there once.
        
        
        - Why do girls put rings on their toes?
        - Why not?
        
        
        - It's like putting a hat on your knee.
        - Maybe I'll try that.
        
        
        - You all right, ma'am?
        - Oh, yeah. Fine.
        
        
        Just having two cups of coffee!
        
        
        Anyway, this has been great.
        Thanks for the coffee.
        
        
        Yeah, it's no trouble.
        
        
        Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
        I'd be up the rest of my life.
        
        
        Are you...?
        
        
        Can I take a piece of this with me?
        
        
        Sure! Here, have a crumb.
        
        
        - Thanks!
        - Yeah.
        
        
        All right. Well, then...
        I guess I'll see you around.
        
        
        Or not.
        
        
        OK, Barry.
        
        
        And thank you
        so much again... for before.
        
        
        Oh, that? That was nothing.
        
        
        Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
        
        
        This can't possibly work.
        
        
        He's all set to go.
        We may as well try it.
        
        
        OK, Dave, pull the chute.
        
        
        - Sounds amazing.
        - It was amazing!
        
        
        It was the scariest,
        happiest moment of my life.
        
        
        Humans! I can't believe
        you were with humans!
        
        
        Giant, scary humans!
        What were they like?
        
        
        Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
        
        
        They eat crazy giant things.
        They drive crazy.
        
        
        - Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
        - Some of them. But some of them don't.
        
        
        - How'd you get back?
        - Poodle.
        
        
        You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
        whatever you wanted to see.
        
        
        You had your "experience." Now you
        can pick out your job and be normal.
        
        
        - Well...
        - Well?
        
        
        Well, I met someone.
        
        
        You did? Was she Bee-ish?
        
        
        - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
        - No, no, no, not a wasp.
        
        
        - Spider?
        - I'm not attracted to spiders.
        
        
        I know it's the hottest thing,
        with the eight legs and all.
        
        
        I can't get by that face.
        
        
        So who is she?
        
        
        She's... human.
        
        
        No, no. That's a bee law.
        You wouldn't break a bee law.
        
        
        - Her name's Vanessa.
        - Oh, boy.
        
        
        She's so nice. And she's a florist!
        
        
        Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
        
        
        We're not dating.
        
        
        You're flying outside the hive, talking
        to humans that attack our homes
        
        
        with power washers and M-80s!
        One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
        
        
        She saved my life!
        And she understands me.
        
        
        This is over!
        
        
        Eat this.
        
        
        This is not over! What was that?
        
        
        - They call it a crumb.
        - It was so stingin' stripey!
        
        
        And that's not what they eat.
        That's what falls off what they eat!
        
        
        - You know what a Oinnabon is?
        - No.
        
        
        It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
        They heat it up...
        
        
        Sit down!
        
        
        ...really hot!
        - Listen to me!
        
        
        We are not them! We're us.
        There's us and there's them!
        
        
        Yes, but who can deny
        the heart that is yearning?
        
        
        There's no yearning.
        Stop yearning. Listen to me!
        
        
        You have got to start thinking bee,
        my friend. Thinking bee!
        
        
        - Thinking bee.
        - Thinking bee.
        
        
        Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
        Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
        
        
        There he is. He's in the pool.
        
        
        You know what your problem is, Barry?
        
        
        I gotta start thinking bee?
        
        
        How much longer will this go on?
        
        
        It's been three days!
        Why aren't you working?
        
        
        I've got a lot of big life decisions
        to think about.
        
        
        What life? You have no life!
        You have no job. You're barely a bee!
        
        
        Would it kill you
        to make a little honey?
        
        
        Barry, come out.
        Your father's talking to you.
        
        
        Martin, would you talk to him?
        
        
        Barry, I'm talking to you!
        
        
        You coming?
        
        
        Got everything?
        
        
        All set!
        
        
        Go ahead. I'll catch up.
        
        
        Don't be too long.
        
        
        Watch this!
        
        
        Vanessa!
        
        
        - We're still here.
        - I told you not to yell at him.
        
        
        He doesn't respond to yelling!
        
        
        - Then why yell at me?
        - Because you don't listen!
        
        
        I'm not listening to this.
        
        
        Sorry, I've gotta go.
        
        
        - Where are you going?
        - I'm meeting a friend.
        
        
        A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
        
        
        Bye.
        
        
        I just hope she's Bee-ish.
        
        
        They have a huge parade
        of flowers every year in Pasadena?
        
        
        To be in the Tournament of Roses,
        that's every florist's dream!
        
        
        Up on a float, surrounded
        by flowers, crowds cheering.
        
        
        A tournament. Do the roses
        compete in athletic events?
        
        
        No. All right, I've got one.
        How come you don't fly everywhere?
        
        
        It's exhausting. Why don't you
        run everywhere? It's faster.
        
        
        Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
        All right, your turn.
        
        
        TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
        That's insane!
        
        
        You don't have that?
        
        
        We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
        It's a horrible, horrible disease.
        
        
        Oh, my.
        
        
        Dumb bees!
        
        
        You must want to sting all those jerks.
        
        
        We try not to sting.
        It's usually fatal for us.
        
        
        So you have to watch your temper.
        
        
        Very carefully.
        You kick a wall, take a walk,
        
        
        write an angry letter and throw it out.
        Work through it like any emotion:
        
        
        Anger, jealousy, lust.
        
        
        Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
        
        
        Yeah.
        
        
        - What is wrong with you?!
        - It's a bug.
        
        
        He's not bothering anybody.
        Get out of here, you creep!
        
        
        What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
        
        
        Yeah, it was. How did you know?
        
        
        It felt like about 10 pages.
        Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
        
        
        You've really got that
        down to a science.
        
        
        - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
        - I'll bet.
        
        
        What in the name
        of Mighty Hercules is this?
        
        
        How did this get here?
        Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,
        
        
        Ray Liotta Private Select?
        
        
        - Is he that actor?
        - I never heard of him.
        
        
        - Why is this here?
        - For people. We eat it.
        
        
        You don't have
        enough food of your own?
        
        
        - Well, yes.
        - How do you get it?
        
        
        - Bees make it.
        - I know who makes it!
        
        
        And it's hard to make it!
        
        
        There's heating, cooling, stirring.
        You need a whole Krelman thing!
        
        
        - It's organic.
        - It's our-ganic!
        
        
        It's just honey, Barry.
        
        
        Just what?!
        
        
        Bees don't know about this!
        This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
        
        
        You've taken our homes, schools,
        hospitals! This is all we have!
        
        
        And it's on sale?!
        I'm getting to the bottom of this.
        
        
        I'm getting to the bottom
        of all of this!
        
        
        Hey, Hector.
        
        
        - You almost done?
        - Almost.
        
        
        He is here. I sense it.
        
        
        Well, I guess I'll go home now
        
        
        and just leave this nice honey out,
        with no one around.
        
        
        You're busted, box boy!
        
        
        I knew I heard something.
        So you can talk!
        
        
        I can talk.
        And now you'll start talking!
        
        
        Where you getting the sweet stuff?
        Who's your supplier?
        
        
        I don't understand.
        I thought we were friends.
        
        
        The last thing we want
        to do is upset bees!
        
        
        You're too late! It's ours now!
        
        
        You, sir, have crossed
        the wrong sword!
        
        
        You, sir, will be lunch
        for my iguana, Ignacio!
        
        
        Where is the honey coming from?
        
        
        Tell me where!
        
        
        Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
        
        
        Orazy person!
        
        
        What horrible thing has happened here?
        
        
        These faces, they never knew
        what hit them. And now
        
        
        they're on the road to nowhere!
        
        
        Just keep still.
        
        
        What? You're not dead?
        
        
        Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
        that moves. Where you headed?
        
        
        To Honey Farms.
        I am onto something huge here.
        
        
        I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
        crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
        
        
        I'm going to Tacoma.
        
        
        - And you?
        - He really is dead.
        
        
        All right.
        
        
        Uh-oh!
        
        
        - What is that?!
        - Oh, no!
        
        
        - A wiper! Triple blade!
        - Triple blade?
        
        
        Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
        
        
        Why does everything have
        to be so doggone clean?!
        
        
        How much do you people need to see?!
        
        
        Open your eyes!
        Stick your head out the window!
        
        
        From NPR News in Washington,
        I'm Carl Kasell.
        
        
        But don't kill no more bugs!
        
        
        - Bee!
        - Moose blood guy!!
        
        
        - You hear something?
        - Like what?
        
        
        Like tiny screaming.
        
        
        Turn off the radio.
        
        
        Whassup, bee boy?
        
        
        Hey, Blood.
        
        
        Just a row of honey jars,
        as far as the eye could see.
        
        
        Wow!
        
        
        I assume wherever this truck goes
        is where they're getting it.
        
        
        I mean, that honey's ours.
        
        
        - Bees hang tight.
        - We're all jammed in.
        
        
        It's a close community.
        
        
        Not us, man. We on our own.
        Every mosquito on his own.
        
        
        - What if you get in trouble?
        - You a mosquito, you in trouble.
        
        
        Nobody likes us. They just smack.
        See a mosquito, smack, smack!
        
        
        At least you're out in the world.
        You must meet girls.
        
        
        Mosquito girls try to trade up,
        get with a moth, dragonfly.
        
        
        Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
        
        
        You got to be kidding me!
        
        
        Mooseblood's about to leave
        the building! So long, bee!
        
        
        - Hey, guys!
        - Mooseblood!
        
        
        I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
        Did you bring your crazy straw?
        
        
        We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
        and it's pretty much pure profit.
        
        
        What is this place?
        
        
        A bee's got a brain
        the size of a pinhead.
        
        
        They are pinheads!
        
        
        Pinhead.
        
        
        - Oheck out the new smoker.
        - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
        
        
        The Thomas 3000!
        
        
        Smoker?
        
        
        Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
        Twice the nicotine, all the tar.
        
        
        A couple breaths of this
        knocks them right out.
        
        
        They make the honey,
        and we make the money.
        
        
        "They make the honey,
        and we make the money"?
        
        
        Oh, my!
        
        
        What's going on? Are you OK?
        
        
        Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
        
        
        Do you know you're
        in a fake hive with fake walls?
        
        
        Our queen was moved here.
        We had no choice.
        
        
        This is your queen?
        That's a man in women's clothes!
        
        
        That's a drag queen!
        
        
        What is this?
        
        
        Oh, no!
        
        
        There's hundreds of them!
        
        
        Bee honey.
        
        
        Our honey is being brazenly stolen
        on a massive scale!
        
        
        This is worse than anything bears
        have done! I intend to do something.
        
        
        Oh, Barry, stop.
        
        
        Who told you humans are taking
        our honey? That's a rumor.
        
        
        Do these look like rumors?
        
        
        That's a conspiracy theory.
        These are obviously doctored photos.
        
        
        How did you get mixed up in this?
        
        
        He's been talking to humans.
        
        
        - What?
        - Talking to humans?!
        
        
        He has a human girlfriend.
        And they make out!
        
        
        Make out? Barry!
        
        
        We do not.
        
        
        - You wish you could.
        - Whose side are you on?
        
        
        The bees!
        
        
        I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
        Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
        
        
        Barry, this is what you want
        to do with your life?
        
        
        I want to do it for all our lives.
        Nobody works harder than bees!
        
        
        Dad, I remember you
        coming home so overworked
        
        
        your hands were still stirring.
        You couldn't stop.
        
        
        I remember that.
        
        
        What right do they have to our honey?
        
        
        We live on two cups a year. They put it
        in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
        
        
        Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
        
        
        Sting them where it really hurts.
        
        
        In the face! The eye!
        
        
        - That would hurt.
        - No.
        
        
        Up the nose? That's a killer.
        
        
        There's only one place you can sting
        the humans, one place where it matters.
        
        
        Hive at Five, the hive's only
        full-hour action news source.
        
        
        No more bee beards!

        - And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
        
        
        A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,
        
        
        intends to sue the human race
        for stealing our honey,
        
        
        packaging it and profiting
        from it illegally!
        
        
        Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
        
        
        we'll have three former queens here in
        our studio, discussing their new book,
        
        
        Classy Ladies,
        out this week on Hexagon.
        
        
        Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
        
        
        Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
        from the hive. I can't do this"?
        
        
        Bees have never been afraid
        to change the world.
        
        
        What about Bee Oolumbus?
        Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
        
        
        Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
        
        
        We were thinking
        of stickball or candy stores.
        
        
        How old are you?
        
        
        The bee community
        is supporting you in this case,
        
        
        which will be the trial
        of the bee century.
        
        
        You know, they have a Larry King
        in the human world too.
        
        
        It's a common name. Next week...
        
        
        He looks like you and has a show
        and suspenders and colored dots...
        
        
        Next week...
        
        
        Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
        guest even though you just heard 'em.
        
        
        Bear Week next week!
        They're scary, hairy and here live.
        
        
        Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
        squinty eyes, very Jewish.
        
        
        In tennis, you attack
        at the point of weakness!
        
        
        It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
        
        
        Honey, her backhand's a joke!
        I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
        
        
        Quiet, please.
        Actual work going on here.
        
        
        - Is that that same bee?
        - Yes, it is!
        
        
        I'm helping him sue the human race.
        
        
        - Hello.
        - Hello, bee.
        
        
        This is Ken.
        
        
        Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
        ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
        
        
        Why does he talk again?
        
        
        Listen, you better go
        'cause we're really busy working.
        
        
        But it's our yogurt night!
        
        
        Bye-bye.
        
        
        Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
        
        
        You poor thing.
        You two have been at this for hours!
        
        
        Yes, and Adam here
        has been a huge help.
        
        
        - Frosting...
        - How many sugars?
        
        
        Just one. I try not
        to use the competition.
        
        
        So why are you helping me?
        
        
        Bees have good qualities.
        
        
        And it takes my mind off the shop.
        
        
        Instead of flowers, people
        are giving balloon bouquets now.
        
        
        Those are great, if you're three.
        
        
        And artificial flowers.
        
        
        - Oh, those just get me psychotic!
        - Yeah, me too.
        
        
        Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
        
        
        Bees must hate those fake things!
        
        
        Nothing worse
        than a daffodil that's had work done.
        
        
        Maybe this could make up
        for it a little bit.
        
        
        - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
        - I guess.
        
        
        You sure you want to go through with it?
        
        
        Am I sure? When I'm done with
        the humans, they won't be able
        
        
        to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
        without paying a royalty!
        
        
        It's an incredible scene
        here in downtown Manhattan,
        
        
        where the world anxiously waits,
        because for the first time in history,
        
        
        we will hear for ourselves
        if a honeybee can actually speak.
        
        
        What have we gotten into here, Barry?
        
        
        It's pretty big, isn't it?
        
        
        I can't believe how many humans
        don't work during the day.
        
        
        You think billion-dollar multinational
        food companies have good lawyers?
        
        
        Everybody needs to stay
        behind the barricade.
        
        
        - What's the matter?
        - I don't know, I just got a chill.
        
        
        Well, if it isn't the bee team.
        
        
        You boys work on this?
        
        
        All rise! The Honorable
        Judge Bumbleton presiding.
        
        
        All right. Case number 4475,
        
        
        Superior Court of New York,
        Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry
        
        
        is now in session.
        
        
        Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
        the five food companies collectively?
        
        
        A privilege.
        
        
        Mr. Benson... you're representing
        all the bees of the world?
        
        
        I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
        we're ready to proceed.
        
        
        Mr. Montgomery,
        your opening statement, please.
        
        
        Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
        
        
        my grandmother was a simple woman.
        
        
        Born on a farm, she believed
        it was man's divine right
        
        
        to benefit from the bounty
        of nature God put before us.
        
        
        If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
        Mr. Benson imagines,
        
        
        just think of what would it mean.
        
        
        I would have to negotiate
        with the silkworm
        
        
        for the elastic in my britches!
        
        
        Talking bee!
        
        
        How do we know this isn't some sort of
        
        
        holographic motion-picture-capture
        Hollywood wizardry?
        
        
        They could be using laser beams!
        
        
        Robotics! Ventriloquism!
        Oloning! For all we know,
        
        
        he could be on steroids!
        
        
        Mr. Benson?
        
        
        Ladies and gentlemen,
        there's no trickery here.
        
        
        I'm just an ordinary bee.
        Honey's pretty important to me.
        
        
        It's important to all bees.
        We invented it!
        
        
        We make it. And we protect it
        with our lives.
        
        
        Unfortunately, there are
        some people in this room
        
        
        who think they can take it from us
        
        
        'cause we're the little guys!
        I'm hoping that, after this is all over,
        
        
        you'll see how, by taking our honey,
        you not only take everything we have
        
        
        but everything we are!
        
        
        I wish he'd dress like that
        all the time. So nice!
        
        
        Call your first witness.
        
        
        So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
        of Honey Farms, big company you have.
        
        
        I suppose so.
        
        
        I see you also own
        Honeyburton and Honron!
        
        
        Yes, they provide beekeepers
        for our farms.
        
        
        Beekeeper. I find that
        to be a very disturbing term.
        
        
        I don't imagine you employ
        any bee-free-ers, do you?
        
        
        - No.
        - I couldn't hear you.
        
        
        - No.
        - No.
        
        
        Because you don't free bees.
        You keep bees. Not only that,
        
        
        it seems you thought a bear would be
        an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
        
        
        They're very lovable creatures.
        
        
        Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
        
        
        You mean like this?
        
        
        Bears kill bees!
        
        
        How'd you like his head crashing
        through your living room?!
        
        
        Biting into your couch!
        Spitting out your throw pillows!
        
        
        OK, that's enough. Take him away.
        
        
        So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
        Your name intrigues me.
        
        
        - Where have I heard it before?
        - I was with a band called The Police.
        
        
        But you've never been
        a police officer, have you?
        
        
        No, I haven't.
        
        
        No, you haven't. And so here
        we have yet another example
        
        
        of bee culture casually
        stolen by a human
        
        
        for nothing more than
        a prance-about stage name.
        
        
        Oh, please.
        
        
        Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
        
        
        Because I'm feeling
        a little stung, Sting.
        
        
        Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
        
        
        That's not his real name?! You idiots!
        
        
        Mr. Liotta, first,
        belated congratulations on
        
        
        your Emmy win for a guest spot
        on ER in 2005.
        
        
        Thank you. Thank you.
        
        
        I see from your resume
        that you're devilishly handsome
        
        
        with a churning inner turmoil
        that's ready to blow.
        
        
        I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
        
        
        Not yet it isn't. But is this
        what it's come to for you?
        
        
        Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
        so you don't
        
        
        have to rehearse
        your part and learn your lines, sir?
        
        
        Watch it, Benson!
        I could blow right now!
        
        
        This isn't a goodfella.
        This is a badfella!
        
        
        Why doesn't someone just step on
        this creep, and we can all go home?!
        
        
        - Order in this court!
        - You're all thinking it!
        
        
        Order! Order, I say!
        
        
        - Say it!
        - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
        
        
        I think it was awfully nice
        of that bear to pitch in like that.
        
        
        I think the jury's on our side.
        
        
        Are we doing everything right, legally?
        
        
        I'm a florist.
        
        
        Right. Well, here's to a great team.
        
        
        To a great team!
        
        
        Well, hello.
        
        
        - Ken!
        - Hello.
        
        
        I didn't think you were coming.
        
        
        No, I was just late.
        I tried to call, but... the battery.
        
        
        I didn't want all this to go to waste,
        so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
        
        
        Oh, that was lucky.
        
        
        There's a little left.
        I could heat it up.
        
        
        Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
        
        
        So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
        
        
        I'm not much for the game myself.
        The ball's a little grabby.
        
        
        That's where I usually sit.
        Right... there.
        
        
        Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,
        
        
        and he agreed with me that eating with
        chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
        
        
        You think I don't see what you're doing?
        
        
        I know how hard it is to find
        the rightjob. We have that in common.
        
        
        Do we?
        
        
        Bees have 100 percent employment,
        but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
        
        
        That's just what
        I was thinking about doing.
        
        
        Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
        for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
        
        
        I'm going to drain the old stinger.
        
        
        Yeah, you do that.
        
        
        Look at that.
        
        
        You know, I've just about had it
        
        
        with your little mind games.
        
        
        - What's that?
        - Italian Vogue.
        
        
        Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
        
        
        A lot of ads.
        
        
        Remember what Van said, why is
        your life more valuable than mine?
        
        
        Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
        
        
        I think something stinks in here!
        
        
        I love the smell of flowers.
        
        
        How do you like the smell of flames?!
        
        
        Not as much.
        
        
        Water bug! Not taking sides!
        
        
        Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
        This is pathetic!
        
        
        I've got issues!
        
        
        Well, well, well, a royal flush!
        
        
        - You're bluffing.
        - Am I?
        
        
        Surf's up, dude!
        
        
        Poo water!
        
        
        That bowl is gnarly.
        
        
        Except for those dirty yellow rings!
        
        
        Kenneth! What are you doing?!
        
        
        You know, I don't even like honey!
        I don't eat it!
        
        
        We need to talk!
        
        
        He's just a little bee!
        
        
        And he happens to be
        the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
        
        
        Long time? What are you talking about?!
        Are there other bugs in your life?
        
        
        No, but there are other things bugging
        me in life. And you're one of them!
        
        
        Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
        
        
        My nerves are fried from riding
        on this emotional roller coaster!
        
        
        Goodbye, Ken.
        
        
        And for your information,
        
        
        I prefer sugar-free, artificial
        sweeteners made by man!
        
        
        I'm sorry about all that.
        
        
        I know it's got
        an aftertaste! I like it!
        
        
        I always felt there was some kind
        of barrier between Ken and me.
        
        
        I couldn't overcome it.
        Oh, well.
        
        
        Are you OK for the trial?
        
        
        I believe Mr. Montgomery
        is about out of ideas.
        
        
        We would like to call
        Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
        
        
        Good idea! You can really see why he's
        considered one of the best lawyers...
        
        
        Yeah.
        
        
        Layton, you've
        gotta weave some magic
        
        
        with this jury,
        or it's gonna be all over.
        
        
        Don't worry. The only thing I have
        to do to turn this jury around
        
        
        is to remind them
        of what they don't like about bees.
        
        
        - You got the tweezers?
        - Are you allergic?
        
        
        Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
        
        
        Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
        what I think we'd all like to know.
        
        
        What exactly is your relationship
        
        
        to that woman?
        
        
        We're friends.
        
        
        - Good friends?
        - Yes.
        
        
        How good? Do you live together?
        
        
        Wait a minute...
        
        
        Are you her little...
        
        
        ...bedbug?
        
        
        I've seen a bee documentary or two.
        From what I understand,
        
        
        doesn't your queen give birth
        to all the bee children?
        
        
        - Yeah, but...
        - So those aren't your real parents!
        
        
        - Oh, Barry...
        - Yes, they are!
        
        
        Hold me back!
        
        
        You're an illegitimate bee,
        aren't you, Benson?
        
        
        He's denouncing bees!
        
        
        Don't y'all date your cousins?
        
        
        - Objection!
        - I'm going to pincushion this guy!
        
        
        Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
        
        
        Oh, I'm hit!!
        
        
        Oh, lordy, I am hit!
        
        
        Order! Order!
        
        
        The venom! The venom
        is coursing through my veins!
        
        
        I have been felled
        by a winged beast of destruction!
        
        
        You see? You can't treat them
        like equals! They're striped savages!
        
        
        Stinging's the only thing
        they know! It's their way!
        
        
        - Adam, stay with me.
        - I can't feel my legs.
        
        
        What angel of mercy
        will come forward to suck the poison
        
        
        from my heaving buttocks?
        
        
        I will have order in this court. Order!
        
        
        Order, please!
        
        
        The case of the honeybees
        versus the human race
        
        
        took a pointed turn against the bees
        
        
        yesterday when one of their legal
        team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
        
        
        - Hey, buddy.
        - Hey.
        
        
        - Is there much pain?
        - Yeah.
        
        
        I...
        
        
        I blew the whole case, didn't I?
        
        
        It doesn't matter. What matters is
        you're alive. You could have died.
        
        
        I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
        
        
        They got it from the cafeteria
        downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
        
        
        Look, there's
        a little celery still on it.
        
        
        What was it like to sting someone?
        
        
        I can't explain it. It was all...
        
        
        All adrenaline and then...
        and then ecstasy!
        
        
        All right.
        
        
        You think it was all a trap?
        
        
        Of course. I'm sorry.
        I flew us right into this.
        
        
        What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
        just a couple of bugs in this world.
        
        
        What will the humans do to us
        if they win?
        
        
        I don't know.
        
        
        I hear they put the roaches in motels.
        That doesn't sound so bad.
        
        
        Adam, they check in,
        but they don't check out!
        
        
        Oh, my.
        
        
        Oould you get a nurse
        to close that window?
        
        
        - Why?
        - The smoke.
        
        
        Bees don't smoke.
        
        
        Right. Bees don't smoke.
        
        
        Bees don't smoke!
        But some bees are smoking.
        
        
        That's it! That's our case!
        
        
        It is? It's not over?
        
        
        Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
        
        
        Get back to the court and stall.
        Stall any way you can.
        
        
        And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.
        
        
        Mr. Flayman.
        
        
        Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
        
        
        Where is the rest of your team?
        
        
        Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
        
        
        Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,
        
        
        and as a result,
        we don't make very good time.
        
        
        I actually heard a funny story about...
        
        
        Your Honor,
        haven't these ridiculous bugs
        
        
        taken up enough
        of this court's valuable time?
        
        
        How much longer will we allow
        these absurd shenanigans to go on?
        
        
        They have presented no compelling
        evidence to support their charges
        
        
        against my clients,
        who run legitimate businesses.
        
        
        I move for a complete dismissal
        of this entire case!
        
        
        Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going
        
        
        to have to consider
        Mr. Montgomery's motion.
        
        
        But you can't! We have a terrific case.
        
        
        Where is your proof?
        Where is the evidence?
        
        
        Show me the smoking gun!
        
        
        Hold it, Your Honor!
        You want a smoking gun?
        
        
        Here is your smoking gun.
        
        
        What is that?
        
        
        It's a bee smoker!
        
        
        What, this?
        This harmless little contraption?
        
        
        This couldn't hurt a fly,
        let alone a bee.
        
        
        Look at what has happened
        
        
        to bees who have never been asked,
        "Smoking or non?"
        
        
        Is this what nature intended for us?
        
        
        To be forcibly addicted
        to smoke machines
        
        
        and man-made wooden slat work camps?
        
        
        Living out our lives as honey slaves
        to the white man?
        
        
        - What are we gonna do?
        - He's playing the species card.
        
        
        Ladies and gentlemen, please,
        free these bees!
        
        
        Free the bees! Free the bees!
        
        
        Free the bees!
        
        
        Free the bees! Free the bees!
        
        
        The court finds in favor of the bees!
        
        
        Vanessa, we won!
        
        
        I knew you could do it! High-five!
        
        
        Sorry.
        
        
        I'm OK! You know what this means?
        
        
        All the honey
        will finally belong to the bees.
        
        
        Now we won't have
        to work so hard all the time.
        
        
        This is an unholy perversion
        of the balance of nature, Benson.
        
        
        You'll regret this.
        
        
        Barry, how much honey is out there?
        
        
        All right. One at a time.
        
        
        Barry, who are you wearing?
        
        
        My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
        and I have no pants.
        
        
        - What if Montgomery's right?
        - What do you mean?
        
        
        We've been living the bee way
        a long time, 27 million years.
        
        
        Oongratulations on your victory.
        What will you demand as a settlement?
        
        
        First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
        of all bee work camps.
        
        
        Then we want back the honey
        that was ours to begin with,
        
        
        every last drop.
        
        
        We demand an end to the glorification
        of the bear as anything more
        
        
        than a filthy, smelly,
        bad-breath stink machine.
        
        
        We're all aware
        of what they do in the woods.
        
        
        Wait for my signal.
        
        
        Take him out.
        
        
        He'll have nauseous
        for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
        
        
        And we will no longer tolerate
        bee-negative nicknames...
        
        
        But it's just a prance-about stage name!
        
        
        ...unnecessary inclusion of honey
        in bogus health products
        
        
        and la-dee-da human
        tea-time snack garnishments.
        
        
        Can't breathe.
        
        
        Bring it in, boys!
        
        
        Hold it right there! Good.
        
        
        Tap it.
        
        
        Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
        and there's gallons more coming!
        
        
        - I think we need to shut down!
        - Shut down? We've never shut down.
        
        
        Shut down honey production!
        
        
        Stop making honey!
        
        
        Turn your key, sir!
        
        
        What do we do now?
        
        
        Cannonball!
        
        
        We're shutting honey production!
        
        
        Mission abort.
        
        
        Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
        Returning to base.
        
        
        Adam, you wouldn't believe
        how much honey was out there.
        
        
        Oh, yeah?
        
        
        What's going on? Where is everybody?
        
        
        - Are they out celebrating?
        - They're home.
        
        
        They don't know what to do.
        Laying out, sleeping in.
        
        
        I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way
        to San Antonio with a cricket.
        
        
        At least we got our honey back.
        
        
        Sometimes I think, so what if humans
        liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
        
        
        It's the greatest thing in the world!
        I was excited to be part of making it.
        
        
        This was my new desk. This was my
        new job. I wanted to do it really well.
        
        
        And now...
        
        
        Now I can't.
        
        
        I don't understand
        why they're not happy.
        
        
        I thought their lives would be better!
        
        
        They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
        Honey really changes people.
        
        
        You don't have any idea
        what's going on, do you?
        
        
        - What did you want to show me?
        - This.
        
        
        What happened here?
        
        
        That is not the half of it.
        
        
        Oh, no. Oh, my.
        
        
        They're all wilting.
        
        
        Doesn't look very good, does it?
        
        
        No.
        
        
        And whose fault do you think that is?
        
        
        You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
        
        
        Bees?
        
        
        Specifically, me.
        
        
        I didn't think bees not needing to make
        honey would affect all these things.
        
        
        It's notjust flowers.
        Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
        
        
        That's our whole SAT test right there.
        
        
        Take away produce, that affects
        the entire animal kingdom.
        
        
        And then, of course...
        
        
        The human species?
        
        
        So if there's no more pollination,
        
        
        it could all just go south here,
        couldn't it?
        
        
        I know this is also partly my fault.
        
        
        How about a suicide pact?
        
        
        How do we do it?
        
        
        - I'll sting you, you step on me.
        - Thatjust kills you twice.
        
        
        Right, right.
        
        
        Listen, Barry...
        sorry, but I gotta get going.
        
        
        I had to open my mouth and talk.
        
        
        Vanessa?
        
        
        Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
        Where are you going?
        
        
        To the final Tournament of Roses parade
        in Pasadena.
        
        
        They've moved it to this weekend
        because all the flowers are dying.
        
        
        It's the last chance
        I'll ever have to see it.
        
        
        Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
        I never meant it to turn out like this.
        
        
        I know. Me neither.
        
        
        Tournament of Roses.
        Roses can't do sports.
        
        
        Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
        
        
        Roses!
        
        
        Vanessa!
        
        
        Roses?!
        
        
        Barry?
        
        
        - Roses are flowers!
        - Yes, they are.
        
        
        Flowers, bees, pollen!
        
        
        I know.
        That's why this is the last parade.
        
        
        Maybe not.
        Oould you ask him to slow down?
        
        
        Oould you slow down?
        
        
        Barry!
        
        
        OK, I made a huge mistake.
        This is a total disaster, all my fault.
        
        
        Yes, it kind of is.
        
        
        I've ruined the planet.
        I wanted to help you
        
        
        with the flower shop.
        I've made it worse.
        
        
        Actually, it's completely closed down.
        
        
        I thought maybe you were remodeling.
        
        
        But I have another idea, and it's
        greater than my previous ideas combined.
        
        
        I don't want to hear it!
        
        
        All right, they have the roses,
        the roses have the pollen.
        
        
        I know every bee, plant
        and flower bud in this park.
        
        
        All we gotta do is get what they've got
        back here with what we've got.
        
        
        - Bees.
        - Park.
        
        
        - Pollen!
        - Flowers.
        
        
        - Repollination!
        - Across the nation!
        
        
        Tournament of Roses,
        Pasadena, California.
        
        
        They've got nothing
        but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
        
        
        Security will be tight.
        
        
        I have an idea.
        
        
        Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
        
        
        Official floral business. It's real.
        
        
        Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
        
        
        Thank you. It was a gift.
        
        
        Once inside,
        we just pick the right float.
        
        
        How about The Princess and the Pea?
        
        
        I could be the princess,
        and you could be the pea!
        
        
        Yes, I got it.
        
        
        - Where should I sit?
        - What are you?
        
        
        - I believe I'm the pea.
        - The pea?
        
        
        It goes under the mattresses.
        
        
        - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
        - I'm getting the marshal.
        
        
        You do that!
        This whole parade is a fiasco!
        
        
        Let's see what this baby'll do.
        
        
        Hey, what are you doing?!
        
        
        Then all we do
        is blend in with traffic...
        
        
        ...without arousing suspicion.
        
        
        Once at the airport,
        there's no stopping us.
        
        
        Stop! Security.
        
        
        - You and your insect pack your float?
        - Yes.
        
        
        Has it been
        in your possession the entire time?
        
        
        Would you remove your shoes?
        
        
        - Remove your stinger.
        - It's part of me.
        
        
        I know. Just having some fun.
        Enjoy your flight.
        
        
        Then if we're lucky, we'll have
        just enough pollen to do the job.
        
        
        Can you believe how lucky we are? We
        have just enough pollen to do the job!
        
        
        I think this is gonna work.
        
        
        It's got to work.
        
        
        Attention, passengers,
        this is Captain Scott.
        
        
        We have a bit of bad weather
        in New York.
        
        
        It looks like we'll experience
        a couple hours delay.
        
        
        Barry, these are cut flowers
        with no water. They'll never make it.
        
        
        I gotta get up there
        and talk to them.
        
        
        Be careful.
        
        
        Can I get help
        with the Sky Mall magazine?
        
        
        I'd like to order the talking
        inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
        
        
        Captain, I'm in a real situation.
        
        
        - What'd you say, Hal?
        - Nothing.
        
        
        Bee!
        
        
        Don't freak out! My entire species...
        
        
        What are you doing?
        
        
        - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
        - Who's an attorney?
        
        
        Don't move.
        
        
        Oh, Barry.
        
        
        Good afternoon, passengers.
        This is your captain.
        
        
        Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
        please report to the cockpit?
        
        
        And please hurry!
        
        
        What happened here?
        
        
        There was a DustBuster,
        a toupee, a life raft exploded.
        
        
        One's bald, one's in a boat,
        they're both unconscious!
        
        
        - Is that another bee joke?
        - No!
        
        
        No one's flying the plane!
        
        
        This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
        What's your status?
        
        
        This is Vanessa Bloome.
        I'm a florist from New York.
        
        
        Where's the pilot?
        
        
        He's unconscious,
        and so is the copilot.
        
        
        Not good. Does anyone onboard
        have flight experience?
        
        
        As a matter of fact, there is.
        
        
        - Who's that?
        - Barry Benson.
        
        
        From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
        
        
        Vanessa, this is nothing more
        than a big metal bee.
        
        
        It's got giant wings, huge engines.
        
        
        I can't fly a plane.
        
        
        - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
        - Yes.
        
        
        How hard could it be?
        
        
        Wait, Barry!
        We're headed into some lightning.
        
        
        This is Bob Bumble. We have some
        late-breaking news from JFK Airport,
        
        
        where a suspenseful scene
        is developing.
        
        
        Barry Benson,
        fresh from his legal victory...
        
        
        That's Barry!
        
        
        ...is attempting to land a plane,
        loaded with people, flowers
        
        
        and an incapacitated flight crew.
        
        
        Flowers?!
        
        
        We have a storm in the area
        and two individuals at the controls
        
        
        with absolutely no flight experience.
        
        
        Just a minute.
        There's a bee on that plane.
        
        
        I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
        and his no-account compadres.
        
        
        They've done enough damage.
        
        
        But isn't he your only hope?
        
        
        Technically, a bee
        shouldn't be able to fly at all.
        
        
        Their wings are too small...
        
        
        Haven't we heard this a million times?
        
        
        "The surface area of the wings
        and body mass make no sense."
        
        
        - Get this on the air!
        - Got it.
        
        
        - Stand by.
        - We're going live.
        
        
        The way we work may be a mystery to you.
        
        
        Making honey takes a lot of bees
        doing a lot of small jobs.
        
        
        But let me tell you about a small job.
        
        
        If you do it well,
        it makes a big difference.
        
        
        More than we realized.
        To us, to everyone.
        
        
        That's why I want to get bees
        back to working together.
        
        
        That's the bee way!
        We're not made of Jell-O.
        
        
        We get behind a fellow.
        
        
        - Black and yellow!
        - Hello!
        
        
        Left, right, down, hover.
        
        
        - Hover?
        - Forget hover.
        
        
        This isn't so hard.
        Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
        
        
        Barry, what happened?!
        
        
        Wait, I think we were
        on autopilot the whole time.
        
        
        - That may have been helping me.
        - And now we're not!
        
        
        So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
        
        
        All of you, let's get
        behind this fellow! Move it out!
        
        
        Move out!
        
        
        Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
        you copy me with the wings of the plane!
        
        
        Don't have to yell.
        
        
        I'm not yelling!
        We're in a lot of trouble.
        
        
        It's very hard to concentrate
        with that panicky tone in your voice!
        
        
        It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
        
        
        I can't do this!
        
        
        Vanessa, pull yourself together.
        You have to snap out of it!
        
        
        You snap out of it.
        
        
        You snap out of it.
        
        
        - You snap out of it!
        - You snap out of it!
        
        
        - You snap out of it!
        - You snap out of it!
        
        
        - You snap out of it!
        - You snap out of it!
        
        
        - Hold it!
        - Why? Oome on, it's my turn.
        
        
        How is the plane flying?
        
        
        I don't know.
        
        
        Hello?
        
        
        Benson, got any flowers
        for a happy occasion in there?
        
        
        The Pollen Jocks!
        
        
        They do get behind a fellow.
        
        
        - Black and yellow.
        - Hello.
        
        
        All right, let's drop this tin can
        on the blacktop.
        
        
        Where? I can't see anything. Can you?
        
        
        No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
        
        
        Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.
        
        
        - Thinking bee.
        - Thinking bee.
        
        
        Thinking bee!
        Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
        
        
        Wait a minute.
        I think I'm feeling something.
        
        
        - What?
        - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
        
        
        Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
        
        
        Bring the nose down.
        
        
        Thinking bee!
        Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
        
        
        - What in the world is on the tarmac?
        - Get some lights on that!
        
        
        Thinking bee!
        Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
        
        
        - Vanessa, aim for the flower.
        - OK.
        
        
        Out the engines. We're going in
        on bee power. Ready, boys?
        
        
        Affirmative!
        
        
        Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
        
        
        Land on that flower!
        
        
        Ready? Full reverse!
        
        
        Spin it around!
        
        
        - Not that flower! The other one!
        - Which one?
        
        
        - That flower.
        - I'm aiming at the flower!
        
        
        That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
        I mean the giant pulsating flower
        
        
        made of millions of bees!
        
        
        Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
        
        
        Rotate around it.
        
        
        - This is insane, Barry!
        - This's the only way I know how to fly.
        
        
        Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
        flying in an insect-like pattern?
        
        
        Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
        Smell it. Full reverse!
        
        
        Just drop it. Be a part of it.
        
        
        Aim for the center!
        
        
        Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
        
        
        Oome on, already.
        
        
        Barry, we did it!
        You taught me how to fly!
        
        
        - Yes. No high-five!
        - Right.
        
        
        Barry, it worked!
        Did you see the giant flower?
        
        
        What giant flower? Where? Of course
        I saw the flower! That was genius!
        
        
        - Thank you.
        - But we're not done yet.
        
        
        Listen, everyone!
        
        
        This runway is covered
        with the last pollen
        
        
        from the last flowers
        available anywhere on Earth.
        
        
        That means this is our last chance.
        
        
        We're the only ones who make honey,
        pollinate flowers and dress like this.
        
        
        If we're gonna survive as a species,
        this is our moment! What do you say?
        
        
        Are we going to be bees, orjust
        Museum of Natural History keychains?
        
        
        We're bees!
        
        
        Keychain!
        
        
        Then follow me! Except Keychain.
        
        
        Hold on, Barry. Here.
        
        
        You've earned this.
        
        
        Yeah!
        
        
        I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
        fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
        
        
        Oh, yeah.
        
        
        That's our Barry.
        
        
        Mom! The bees are back!
        
        
        If anybody needs
        to make a call, now's the time.
        
        
        I got a feeling we'll be
        working late tonight!
        
        
        Here's your change. Have a great
        afternoon! Can I help who's next?
        
        
        Would you like some honey with that?
        It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
        
        
        Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
        And I don't see a nickel!
        
        
        Sometimes I just feel
        like a piece of meat!
        
        
        I had no idea.
        
        
        Barry, I'm sorry.
        Have you got a moment?
        
        
        Would you excuse me?
        My mosquito associate will help you.
        
        
        Sorry I'm late.
        
        
        He's a lawyer too?
        
        
        I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
        All I needed was a briefcase.
        
        
        Have a great afternoon!
        
        
        Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
        and I can't get them anywhere.
        
        
        No problem, Vannie.
        Just leave it to me.
        
        
        You're a lifesaver, Barry.
        Can I help who's next?
        
        
        All right, scramble, jocks!
        It's time to fly.
        
        
        Thank you, Barry!
        
        
        That bee is living my life!
        
        
        Let it go, Kenny.
        
        
        - When will this nightmare end?!
        - Let it all go.
        
        
        - Beautiful day to fly.
        - Sure is.
        
        
        Between you and me,
        I was dying to get out of that office.
        
        
        You have got
        to start thinking bee, my friend.
        
        
        - Thinking bee!
        - Me?
        
        
        Hold it. Let's just stop
        for a second. Hold it.
        
        
        I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
        Can we stop here?
        
        
        I'm not making a major life decision
        during a production number!
        
        
        All right. Take ten, everybody.
        Wrap it up, guys.
        
        
        I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

            Please, don't turn me in. I'll never
            Be stubborn again. I can change. Please!
            Give me another chance!
            
            OLD WOMAN
            Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)
            
            DONKEY
            Oh!
            
            HEAD GUARD
            Next! What have you got?
            
            GIPETTO
            This little wooden puppet
            
            PINOCCHIO
            I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his
            Nose grows)
            
            HEAD GUARD
            Five shillings for the possessed toy
            Take it away
            
            PINOCCHIO
            Father, please! Don't let them do this!
            Help me!
            
            Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up
            To the table
            
            HEAD GUARD
            Next! What have you got?
            
            OLD WOMAN
            Well, I've got a talking donkey
            
            HEAD GUARD
            Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings
            If you can prove it
            
            OLD WOMAN
            Oh, go ahead, little fella
            
            Donkey just looks up at her
            
            HEAD GUARD
            Well?
            
            OLD WOMAN
            Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little
            Nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox
            Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
            
            HEAD GUARD
            That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
            
            
            OLD WOMAN
            No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends
            To be Donkey) I can talk. I love to
            Talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing
            You ever saw
            
            HEAD GUARD
            Get her out of my sight
            
            OLD WOMAN
            No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!
            
            The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One
            Of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's
            Hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled
            With fairy dust and he's able to fly
            
            DONKEY
            Hey! I can fly!
            
            PETER PAN
            He can fly!
            
            3 LITTLE PIGS
            He can fly!
            
            HEAD GUARD
            He can talk!
            
            DONKEY
            Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm
            A flying, talking donkey. You might
            Have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly
            But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey
            Fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins
            To wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink
            To the ground.)
            
            He hits the ground with a thud
            
            HEAD GUARD
            Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.)
            After him!
            
            GUARDS
            He's getting away! Get him! This way!
            Turn!
            
            Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally
            Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared
            For a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He
            Quickly hides behind Shrek
            
            HEAD GUARD
            You there. Ogre!
            
            SHREK
            Aye?
            
            HEAD GUARD
            By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized
            To place you both under arrest and transport
            You to a designated resettlement facility
            
            
            SHREK
            Oh, really? You and what army?
            
            He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well
            And we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail
            And runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and
            Begins walking back to his cottage
            
            DONKEY
            Can I say something to you? Listen
            You was really, really, really somethin'
            Back here. Incredible!
            
            SHREK
            Are you talkin' to...(he turns around
            And Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back
            Around and Donkey is right in front
            Of him.) Whoa!
            
            DONKEY
            Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell
            You that you that you was great back
            Here? Those guards! They thought they
            Was all of that. Then you showed up
            And bam! They was trippin' over themselves
            Like babes in the woods. That really
            Made me feel good to see that
            
            SHREK
            Oh, that's great. Really
            
            DONKEY
            Man, it's good to be free
            
            SHREK
            Now, why don't you go celebrate your
            Freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
            
            
            DONKEY
            But, uh, I don't have any friends. And
            I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey
            Wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll
            Stick with you. You're mean, green
            Fightin' machine. Together we'll scare
            The spit out of anybody that crosses
            Us
            
            Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very
            Loudly
            
            DONKEY
            Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you
            Don't mind me sayin', if that don't
            Work, your breath certainly will get
            The job done, 'cause you definitely
            Need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause
            You breath stinks! You almost burned
            The hair outta my nose, just like the
            Time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey
            Continues to talk, so Shrek removes
            His hand.) ...then I ate some rotten
            Berries. I had strong gases leaking
            Out of my butt that day
            
            SHREK
            Why are you following me?
            
            DONKEY
            I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause
            I'm all alone, There's no one here beside
            Me, My problems have all gone, There's
            No one to deride me, But you gotta have
            Faith...
            
            SHREK
            Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't
            Have any friends
            
            DONKEY
            Wow. Only a true friend would be that
            Cruelly honest
            
            SHREK
            Listen, little donkey. Take a look at
            Me. What am I?
            
            DONKEY
            (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really
            Tall?
            
            SHREK
            No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your
            Torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that
            Bother you?
            
            DONKEY
            Nope
            
            SHREK
            Really?
            
            DONKEY
            Really, really
            
            SHREK
            Oh
            
            DONKEY
            Man, I like you. What's you name?
            
            SHREK
            Uh, Shrek
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek? Well, you know what I like about
            You, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me
            Thing. I like that. I respect that
            Shrek. You all right. (They come over
            A hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.)
            Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live
            In place like that?
            
            SHREK
            That would be my home
            
            DONKEY
            Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful
            You know you are quite a decorator
            It's amazing what you've done with such
            A modest budget. I like that boulder
            That is a nice boulder. I guess you
            Don't entertain much, do you?
            
            SHREK
            I like my privacy
            
            DONKEY
            You know, I do too. That's another thing
            We have in common. Like I hate it when
            You got somebody in your face. You've
            Trying to give them a hint, and they
            Won't leave. There's that awkward silence
            (awkward silence) Can I stay wit' you?
            
            
            SHREK
            Uh, what?
            
            DONKEY
            Can I stay wit' you, please?
            
            SHREK
            (sarcastically) Of course!
            
            DONKEY
            Really?
            
            SHREK
            No
            
            DONKEY
            Please! I don't wanna go back there!
            You don't know what it's like to be
            Considered a freak. (pause while he
            Looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do
            But that's why we gotta stick together
            You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
            
            
            SHREK
            Okay! Okay! But one night only
            
            DONKEY
            Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
            
            
            SHREK
            What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto
            A chair.) No! No!
            
            DONKEY
            This is gonna be fun! We can stay up
            Late, swappin' manly stories, and in
            The mornin' I'm makin' waffles
            
            SHREK
            Oh!
            
            DONKEY
            Where do, uh, I sleep?
            
            SHREK
            (irritated) Outside!
            
            DONKEY
            Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean
            I don't know you, and you don't know
            Me, so I guess outside is best, you
            Know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek
            Slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do
            Like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was
            Born outside. I'll just be sitting by
            Myself outside, I guess, you know. By
            Myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's
            No one here beside me...
            
            SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT
            
            Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights
            A candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a
            Noise. He stands up with a huff
            
            SHREK
            (to Donkey) I thought I told you to
            Stay outside
            
            DONKEY
            (from the window) I am outside
            
            There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that
            Made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns
            And spots 3 blind mice on his table
            
            BLIND MOUSE1
            Well, gents, it's a far cry from the
            Farm, but what choice do we have?
            
            
            BLIND MOUSE2
            It's not home, but it'll do just fine
            
            
            GORDO
            (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed
            
            
            SHREK
            Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes
            And lands on his shoulder.)
            
            GORDO
            I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's
            Ear)
            
            SHREK
            Ow!
            
            GORDO
            Blah! Awful stuff
            
            BLIND MOUSE1
            Is that you, Gordo?
            
            GORDO
            How did you know?
            
            SHREK
            Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are
            You doing in my house? (He gets bumped
            From behind and he drops the mice.)
            Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves
            With Snow White on the table.) Oh, no
            No, no. Dead broad off the table
            
            
            DWARF
            Where are we supposed to put her? The
            Bed's taken
            
            SHREK
            Huh?
            
            Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain
            The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at
            Him
            
            BIG BAD WOLF
            What?
            
            TIME LAPSE
            
            Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging
            Him to the front door
            
            SHREK
            I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm
            A terrifying ogre! What do I have to
            Do get a little privacy? (He opens the
            Front door to throw the Wolf out and
            He sees that all the collected Fairy
            Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh
            No. No! No!
            
            The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his
            Pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing
            Flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc
            
            
            SHREK
            What are you doing in my swamp? (this
            Echoes and everyone falls silent.)
            
            
            Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a
            Tent
            
            SHREK
            All right, get out of here. All of you
            Move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya!
            Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more
            Dwarves run inside the house) No, no!
            No, no. Not there. Not there. (they
            Shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to
            Look at Donkey)
            
            DONKEY
            Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite
            Them
            
            PINOCCHIO
            Oh, gosh, no one invited us
            
            SHREK
            What?
            
            PINOCCHIO
            We were forced to come here
            
            SHREK
            (flabbergasted) By who?
            
            LITTLE PIG
            Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed
            And he...signed an eviction notice
            
            
            SHREK
            (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where
            This Farquaad guy is?
            
            Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers
            
            DONKEY
            Oh, I do. I know where he is
            
            SHREK
            Does anyone else know where to find
            Him? Anyone at all?
            
            DONKEY
            Me! Me!
            
            SHREK
            Anyone?
            
            DONKEY
            Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know!
            Me, me!
            
            SHREK
            (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy
            Tale things. Do not get comfortable
            Your welcome is officially worn out
            In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad
            Right now and get you all off my land
            And back where you came from! (Pause
            Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey)
            You! You're comin' with me
            
            DONKEY
            All right, that's what I like to hear
            Man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart
            Friends, off on a whirlwind big-city
            Adventure. I love it!
            
            DONKEY
            (singing) On the road again. Sing it
            With me, Shrek. I can't wait to get
            On the road again
            
            SHREK
            What did I say about singing?
            
            DONKEY
            Can I whistle?
            
            SHREK
            No
            
            DONKEY
            Can I hum it?
            
            SHREK
            All right, hum it
            
            Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'
            
            DULOC - KITCHEN
            
            A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually
            Dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in
            
            FARQUAAD
            That's enough. He's ready to talk
            
            
            The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down
            Onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the
            Table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes
            Up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered
            
            
            FARQUAAD
            (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs
            And plays with them) Run, run, run
            As fast as you can. You can't catch
            Me. I'm the gingerbread man
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN
            You are a monster
            
            FARQUAAD
            I'm not the monster here. You are. You
            And the rest of that fairy tale trash
            Poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell
            Me! Where are the others?
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN
            Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's
            Eye.)
            
            FARQUAAD
            I've tried to be fair to you creatures
            Now my patience has reached its end!
            Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to
            Pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)
            
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN
            No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop
            Buttons
            
            FARQUAAD
            All right then. Who's hiding them?
            
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN
            Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the
            Muffin man?
            
            FARQUAAD
            The muffin man?
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN
            The muffin man
            
            FARQUAAD
            Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives
            On Drury Lane?
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN
            Well, she's married to the muffin man
            
            
            FARQUAAD
            The muffin man?
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN
            The muffin man!
            
            FARQUAAD
            She's married to the muffin man
            
            The door opens and the Head Guard walks in
            
            HEAD GUARD
            My lord! We found it
            
            FARQUAAD
            Then what are you waiting for? Bring
            It in
            
            More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet
            They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic
            Mirror
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN
            (in awe) Ohhhh...
            
            FARQUAAD
            Magic mirror...
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN
            Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks
            Him up and dumps him into a trash can
            With a lid.) No!
            
            FARQUAAD
            Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall
            Is this not the most perfect kingdom
            Of them all?
            
            MIRROR
            Well, technically you're not a king
            
            
            FARQUAAD
            Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a
            Hand mirror and smashes it with his
            Fist.) You were saying?
            
            MIRROR
            What I mean is you're not a king yet
            But you can become one. All you have
            To do is marry a princess
            
            FARQUAAD
            Go on
            
            MIRROR
            (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back
            And relax, my lord, because it's time
            For you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes
            And here they are! Bachelorette number
            One is a mentally abused shut-in from
            A kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi
            And hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies
            Include cooking and cleaning for her
            Two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella
            (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette
            Number two is a cape-wearing girl from
            The land of fancy. Although she lives
            With seven other men, she's not easy
            Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and
            Find out what a live wire she is. Come
            On. Give it up for Snow White! (shows
            Picture of Snow White) And last, but
            Certainly not last, bachelorette number
            Three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded
            Castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!
            But don't let that cool you off. She's
            A loaded pistol who likes pina colads
            And getting caught in the rain. Yours
            For the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows
            Picture of Princess Fiona) So will it
            Be bachelorette number one, bachelorette
            Number two or bachelorette number three?
            
            
            GUARDS
            Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!
            
            
            FARQUAAD
            Three? One? Three?
            
            THELONIUS
            Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number
            Three, my lord!
            
            FARQUAAD
            Okay, okay, uh, number three!
            
            MIRROR
            Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess
            Fiona
            
            FARQUAAD
            Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I
            Have to do is just find someone who
            Can go...
            
            MIRROR
            But I probably should mention the little
            Thing that happens at night
            
            FARQUAAD
            I'll do it
            
            MIRROR
            Yes, but after sunset...
            
            FARQUAAD
            Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona
            My queen, and DuLoc will finally have
            The perfect king! Captain, assemble
            Your finest men. We're going to have
            A tournament. (smiles evilly)
            
            DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section
            
            Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking
            Lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high
            
            DONKEY
            But that's it. That's it right there
            That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it
            
            
            SHREK
            So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle
            
            
            DONKEY
            Uh-huh. That's the place
            
            SHREK
            Do you think maybe he's compensating
            For something? (He laughs, but then
            Groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke
            He continues walking through the parking
            Lot.)
            
            DONKEY
            Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek
            
            MAN
            Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry
            
            
            SHREK
            Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing
            A giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad
            Screams and begins running through the
            Rows of rope to get to the front gate
            To get away from Shrek.) Wait a second
            Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just
            - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins
            Walking straight through the rows. The
            Attendant runs into a wall and falls
            Down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then
            Continue on into DuLoc.)
            
            DULOC
            
            They look around but all is quiet
            
            SHREK
            It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
            
            
            DONKEY
            Hey, look at this!
            
            Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box
            Marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors
            Open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin
            To sing
            
            WOODEN PEOPLE
            Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town
            
            
            Here we have some rules
            
            Let us lay them down
            
            Don't make waves, stay in line
            
            And we'll get along fine
            
            DuLoc is perfect place
            
            Please keep off of the grass
            
            Shine your shoes, wipe your... face
            
            DuLoc is, DuLoc is
            
            DuLoc is perfect place
            
            Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture
            
            DONKEY
            Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready
            To run over and pull the lever again)
            
            
            SHREK
            (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still)
            No. No. No, no, no! No
            
            They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena
            
            FARQUAAD
            Brave knights. You are the best and
            Brightest in all the land. Today one
            Of you shall prove himself...
            
            As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena
            Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song
            
            SHREK
            All right. You're going the right way
            For a smacked bottom
            
            DONKEY
            Sorry about that
            
            FARQUAAD
            That champion shall have the honor -
            - no, no - - the privilege to go forth
            And rescue the lovely Princess Fiona
            From the fiery keep of the dragon. If
            For any reason the winner is unsuccessful
            The first runner-up will take his place
            And so on and so forth. Some of you
            May die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing
            To make. (cheers) Let the tournament
            Begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is
            That? It's hideous!
            
            SHREK
            (turns to look at Donkey and then back
            At Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice
            It's just a donkey
            
            FARQUAAD
            Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who
            Kills the ogre will be named champion!
            Have it him!
            
            MEN
            Get him!
            
            SHREK
            Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps
            Into a table where there are mugs of
            Beer)
            
            CROWD
            Go ahead! Get him!
            
            SHREK
            (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just
            Settle this over a pint?
            
            CROWD
            Kill the beast!
            
            SHREK
            No? All right then. (drinks the beer)
            Come on!
            
            He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel
            Of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the
            Other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides
            Past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped
            As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger
            Beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll
            Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much
            Fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice
            To say that Shrek kicks butt
            
            DONKEY
            Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!
            
            Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek
            Gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd
            
            SHREK
            Yeah!
            
            A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time
            And sees him
            
            WOMAN
            The chair! Give him the chair!
            
            Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men
            Are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding
            Sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild
            
            SHREK
            Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you
            Very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try
            The veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)
            
            The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on
            Shrek
            
            HEAD GUARD
            Shall I give the order, sir?
            
            FARQUAAD
            No, I have a better idea. People of
            DuLoc, I give you our champion!
            
            SHREK
            What?
            
            FARQUAAD
            Congratulations, ogre. You're won the
            Honor of embarking on a great and noble
            Quest
            
            SHREK
            Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest
            To get my swamp back
            
            FARQUAAD
            Your swamp?
            
            SHREK
            Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those
            Fairy tale creatures!
            
            FARQUAAD
            Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you
            A deal. Go on this quest for me, and
            I'll give you your swamp back
            
            SHREK
            Exactly the way it was?
            
            FARQUAAD
            Down to the last slime-covered toadstool
            
            
            SHREK
            And the squatters?
            
            FARQUAAD
            As good as gone
            
            SHREK
            What kind of quest?
            
            Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field
            Heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion
            
            DONKEY
            Let me get this straight. You're gonna
            Go fight a dragon and rescue a princess
            Just so Farquaad will give you back
            A swamp which you only don't have because
            He filled it full of freaks in the first
            Place. Is that about right?
            
            SHREK
            You know, maybe there's a good reason
            Donkeys shouldn't talk
            
            DONKEY
            I don't get it. Why don't you just pull
            Some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle
            Him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds
            His bones to make your bread, the whole
            Ogre trip
            
            SHREK
            Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have
            Decapitated an entire village and put
            Their heads on a pike, gotten a knife
            Cut open their spleen and drink their
            Fluids. Does that sound good to you?
            
            
            DONKEY
            Uh, no, not really, no
            
            SHREK
            For your information, there's a lot
            More to ogres than people think
            
            DONKEY
            Example?
            
            SHREK
            Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions
            (he holds out his onion)
            
            DONKEY
            (sniffs the onion) They stink?
            
            SHREK
            Yes - - No!
            
            DONKEY
            They make you cry?
            
            SHREK
            No!
            
            DONKEY
            You leave them in the sun, they get
            All brown, start sproutin' little white
            Hairs
            
            SHREK
            No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres
            Have layers! Onions have layers. You
            Get it? We both have layers. (he heaves
            A sigh and then walks off)
            
            DONKEY
            (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both
            Have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know
            Not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody
            Loves cakes! Cakes have layers
            
            SHREK
            I don't care... what everyone likes
            Ogres are not like cakes
            
            DONKEY
            You know what else everybody likes?
            Parfaits. Have you ever met a person
            You say, "Let's get some parfait," they
            Say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"?
            Parfaits are delicious
            
            SHREK
            No! You dense, irritating, miniature
            Beast of burden! Ogres are like onions!
            And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later
            
            
            DONKEY
            Parfaits may be the most delicious thing
            On the whole damn planet
            
            SHREK
            You know, I think I preferred your humming
            
            
            DONKEY
            Do you have a tissue or something? I'm
            Making a mess. Just the word parfait
            Make me start slobbering
            
            They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through
            A field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying
            To put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem
            So Donkey pees on the fire to put it out
            
            DRAGON'S KEEP
            
            Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to
            House Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano
            
            
            DONKEY
            (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?
            You gotta warn somebody before you just
            Crack one off. My mouth was open and
            Everything
            
            SHREK
            Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd
            Be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We
            Must be getting close
            
            DONKEY
            Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking
            About it's the brimstone. I know what
            I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It
            Didn't come off no stone neither
            
            
            They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There
            Is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where
            The castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very
            Foreboding
            
            SHREK
            Sure, it's big enough, but look at the
            Location. (laughs...then the laugh turns
            Into a groan)
            
            DONKEY
            Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said
            Ogres have layers?
            
            SHREK
            Oh, aye
            
            DONKEY
            Well, I have a bit of a confession to
            Make. Donkeys don't have layers. We
            Wear our fear right out there on our
            Sleeves
            
            SHREK
            Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves
            
            
            DONKEY
            You know what I mean
            
            SHREK
            You can't tell me you're afraid of heights
            
            
            DONKEY
            No, I'm just a little uncomfortable
            About being on a rickety bridge over
            A boiling like of lava!
            
            SHREK
            Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside
            Ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll
            Just tackle this thing together one
            Little baby step at a time
            
            DONKEY
            Really?
            
            SHREK
            Really, really
            
            DONKEY
            Okay, that makes me feel so much better
            
            
            SHREK
            Just keep moving. And don't look down
            
            
            DONKEY
            Okay, don't look down. Don't look down
            Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't
            Look down. (he steps through a rotting
            Board and ends up looking straight down
            Into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down!
            Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me
            Off, please!
            
            SHREK
            But you're already halfway
            
            DONKEY
            But I know that half is safe!
            
            SHREK
            Okay, fine. I don't have time for this
            You go back
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek, no! Wait!
            
            SHREK
            Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance
            Then, shall me? (bounces and sways the
            Bridge)
            
            DONKEY
            Don't do that!
            
            SHREK
            Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces
            The bridge again)
            
            DONKEY
            Yes, that!
            
            SHREK
            Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to
            Bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across
            The bridge)
            
            DONKEY
            No, Shrek! No! Stop it!
            
            SHREK
            You said do it! I'm doin' it
            
            DONKEY
            I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek
            I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground)
            Oh!
            
            SHREK
            That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks
            Towards the castle)
            
            DONKEY
            Cool. So where is this fire-breathing
            Pain-in-the-neck anyway?
            
            SHREK
            Inside, waiting for us to rescue her
            (chuckles)
            
            DONKEY
            I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek
            
            
            INSIDE THE CASTLE
            
            DONKEY
            You afraid?
            
            SHREK
            No
            
            DONKEY
            But...
            
            SHREK
            Shh
            
            DONKEY
            Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton
            And gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong
            With bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible
            Response to an unfamiliar situation
            Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might
            Add. With a dragon that breathes fire
            And eats knights and breathes fire
            It sure doesn't mean you're a coward
            If you're a little scared. I sure as
            Heck ain't no coward. I know that
            
            
            SHREK
            Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up
            Now go over there and see if you can
            Find any stairs
            
            DONKEY
            Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for
            The princess
            
            SHREK
            (putting on a helmet) The princess will
            Be up the stairs in the highest room
            In the tallest tower
            
            DONKEY
            What makes you think she'll be there?
            
            
            SHREK
            I read it in a book once. (walks off)
            
            
            DONKEY
            Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle
            The stairs. I'll find those stairs
            I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs
            Won't know which way they're goin'
            (walks off)
            
            EMPTY ROOM
            
            Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room
            
            
            DONKEY
            I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it
            To the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm
            The stair master. I've mastered the
            Stairs. I wish I had a step right here
            I'd step all over it
            
            ELSEWHERE
            
            Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window
            
            SHREK
            Well, at least we know where the princess
            Is, but where's the...
            
            DONKEY
            (os) Dragon!
            
            Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again
            Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon
            Breathes fire
            
            SHREK
            Donkey, look out! (he manages to get
            A hold of the dragons tail and holds
            On) Got ya!
            
            The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek
            Goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the
            Tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying
            On the floor
            
            DONKEY
            Oh! Aah! Aah!
            
            Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small
            Part of the bridge he's on
            
            DONKEY
            No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh
            What large teeth you have. (the dragon
            Growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth
            I know you probably hear this all time
            From your food, but you must bleach
            'cause that is one dazzling smile you
            Got there. Do I detect a hint of minty
            Freshness? And you know what else? You're
            - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure!
            I mean, of course you're a girl dragon
            You're just reeking of feminine beauty
            (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes
            At him) What's the matter with you?
            You got something in your eye? Ohh
            Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay
            But you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon
            Blows a smoke ring in the shape of a
            Heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm
            An asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd
            Work out if you're gonna blow smoke
            Rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him
            Up with her teeth and carries him off)
            No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
            
            FIONA'S ROOM
            
            Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona
            So she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She
            Then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off
            The side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep
            Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for
            A moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders
            And shakes her away
            
            FIONA
            Oh! Oh!
            
            SHREK
            Wake up!
            
            FIONA
            What?
            
            SHREK
            Are you Princess Fiona?
            
            FIONA
            I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to
            Rescue me
            
            SHREK
            Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!
            
            FIONA
            But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our
            First meeting. Should it not be a wonderful
            Romantic moment?
            
            SHREK
            Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time
            
            
            FIONA
            Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should
            Sweep me off my feet out yonder window
            And down a rope onto your valiant steed
            
            
            SHREK
            You've had a lot of time to plan this
            Haven't you?
            
            FIONA
            (smiles) Mm-hmm
            
            Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down
            The hallway
            
            FIONA
            But we have to savor this moment! You
            Could recite an epic poem for me. A
            Ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
            
            
            SHREK
            I don't think so
            
            FIONA
            Can I at least know the name of my champion?
            
            
            SHREK
            Uh, Shrek
            
            FIONA
            Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds
            Out a handkerchief) I pray that you
            Take this favor as a token of my gratitude
            
            
            SHREK
            Thanks!
            
            Suddenly they hear the dragon roar
            
            FIONA
            (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?
            
            
            SHREK
            It's on my to-do list. Now come on!
            (takes off running and drags Fiona behind
            Him.)
            
            FIONA
            But this isn't right! You were meant
            To charge in, sword drawn, banner flying
            That's what all the other knights did
            
            
            SHREK
            Yeah, right before they burst into flame
            
            
            FIONA
            That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly
            Stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek
            Ignores her and heads for a wooden door
            Off to the side.) Wait. Where are you
            Going? The exit's over there
            
            SHREK
            Well, I have to save my ass
            
            FIONA
            What kind of knight are you?
            
            SHREK
            One of a kind. (opens the door into
            The throne room)
            
            DONKEY
            (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please
            I believe it's healthy to get to know
            Someone over a long period of time
            Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs
            Worriedly) (we see him up close and
            From a distance as Shrek sneaks into
            The room) I don't want to rush into
            A physical relationship. I'm not emotionally
            Ready for a commitment of, uh, this
            - - Magnitude really is the word I'm
            Looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that
            Is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what
            Are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just
            Back up a little and take this one step
            At a time. We really should get to know
            Each other first as friends or pen pals
            I'm on the road a lot, but I just love
            Receiving cards - - I'd really love
            To stay, but - - Don't do that! That's
            My tail! That's my personal tail. You're
            Gonna tear it off. I don't give permission
            - - What are you gonna do with that?
            Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No
            No, no, no. No! Oh!
            
            Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings
            Toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks
            Up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head
            He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps
            Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him
            Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and
            Roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto
            Her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms
            A sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey
            Take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and
            Then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her
            
            DONKEY
            Hi, Princess!
            
            FIONA
            It talks!
            
            SHREK
            Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's
            The trick
            
            They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots
            A descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a
            Crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His
            Eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles
            Off and walks lightly
            
            SHREK
            Oh!
            
            Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona
            
            
            SHREK
            Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll
            Take care of the dragon
            
            Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the
            Castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping
            Chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that
            Is still around the dragons neck
            
            SHREK
            (echoing) Run!
            
            They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot
            Pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons
            Breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on
            For dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They
            Are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look
            In horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to
            Get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the
            Dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs
            Quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a
            Sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away
            
            FIONA
            (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You
            Did it! You rescued me! You're amazing
            (behind her Donkey falls down the hill)
            You're - - You're wonderful. You're...
            (turns and sees Shrek fall down the
            Hill and bump into Donkey) a little
            Unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed
            Is great, and thy heart is pure. I am
            Eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears
            His throat.) And where would a brave
            Knight be without his noble steed?
            
            
            DONKEY
            I hope you heard that. She called me
            A noble steed. She think I'm a steed
            
            
            FIONA
            The battle is won. You may remove your
            Helmet, good Sir Knight
            
            SHREK
            Uh, no
            
            FIONA
            Why not?
            
            SHREK
            I have helmet hair
            
            FIONA
            Please. I would'st look upon the face
            Of my rescuer
            
            SHREK
            No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st
            
            FIONA
            But how will you kiss me?
            
            SHREK
            What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the
            Job description
            
            DONKEY
            Maybe it's a perk
            
            FIONA
            No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know
            How it goes. A princess locked in a
            Tower and beset by a dragon is rescued
            By a brave knight, and then they share
            True love's first kiss
            
            DONKEY
            Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait
            Wait. You think that Shrek is you true
            Love?
            
            FIONA
            Well, yes
            
            Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing
            
            DONKEY
            You think Shrek is your true love!
            
            
            FIONA
            What is so funny?
            
            SHREK
            Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona:
            Of course, you are. You're my rescuer
            Now - - Now remove your helmet
            
            SHREK
            Look. I really don't think this is a
            Good idea
            
            FIONA
            Just take off the helmet
            
            SHREK
            I'm not going to
            
            FIONA
            Take it off
            
            SHREK
            No!
            
            FIONA
            Now!
            
            SHREK
            Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness
            (takes off his helmet)
            
            FIONA
            You- - You're a- - an ogre
            
            SHREK
            Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming
            
            
            FIONA
            Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is
            All wrong. You're not supposed to be
            An ogre
            
            SHREK
            Princess, I was sent to rescue you by
            Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who
            Wants to marry you
            
            FIONA
            Then why didn't he come rescue me?
            
            
            SHREK
            Good question. You should ask him that
            When we get there
            
            FIONA
            But I have to be rescued by my true
            Love, not by some ogre and his- - his
            Pet
            
            DONKEY
            Well, so much for noble steed
            
            SHREK
            You're not making my job any easier
            
            
            FIONA
            I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem
            You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he
            Wants to rescue me properly, I'll be
            Waiting for him right here
            
            SHREK
            Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all
            Right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy
            (he swiftly picks her up and swings
            Her over his shoulder like she was a
            Sack of potatoes)
            
            FIONA
            You wouldn't dare. Put me down!
            
            SHREK
            Ya comin', Donkey?
            
            DONKEY
            I'm right behind ya
            
            FIONA
            Put me down, or you will suffer the
            Consequences! This is not dignified!
            Put me down!
            
            WOODS
            
            A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just
            Hangs there limply while Shrek carries her
            
            DONKEY
            Okay, so here's another question. Say
            There's a woman that digs you, right
            But you don't really like her that way
            How do you let her down real easy so
            Her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't
            Get burned to a crisp and eaten?
            
            FIONA
            You just tell her she's not your true
            Love. Everyone knows what happens when
            You find your...(Shrek drops her on
            The ground) Hey! The sooner we get to
            DuLoc the better
            
            DONKEY
            You're gonna love it there, Princess
            It's beautiful!
            
            FIONA
            And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?
            What's he like?
            
            SHREK
            Let me put it this way, Princess. Men
            Of Farquaad's stature are in short supply
            (he and Donkey laugh)
            
            Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off
            The dust and grime
            
            DONKEY
            I don't know. There are those who think
            Little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona:
            Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're
            Just jealous you can never measure up
            To a great ruler like Lord Farquaad
            
            
            SHREK
            Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess
            But I'll let you do the "measuring"
            When you see him tomorrow
            
            FIONA
            (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow?
            It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop
            To make camp?
            
            SHREK
            No, that'll take longer. We can keep
            Going
            
            FIONA
            But there's robbers in the woods
            
            DONKEY
            Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting
            To sound good
            
            SHREK
            Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything
            We're going to see in this forest
            
            
            FIONA
            I need to find somewhere to camp now!
            
            
            Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her
            
            
            MOUNTAIN CLIFF
            
            Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves
            A stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave
            
            SHREK
            Hey! Over here
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek, we can do better than that. I
            Don't think this is fit for a princess
            
            
            FIONA
            No, no, it's perfect. It just needs
            A few homey touches
            
            SHREK
            Homey touches? Like what? (he hears
            A tearing noise and looks over at Fiona
            Who has torn the bark off of a tree.)
            
            
            FIONA
            A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee
            Good night. (goes into the cave and
            Puts the bark door up behind her)
            
            
            DONKEY
            You want me to read you a bedtime story?
            I will
            
            FIONA
            (os) I said good night!
            
            Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the
            Boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona
            Still inside
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek, What are you doing?
            
            SHREK
            (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh
            Come on. I was just kidding
            
            LATER THAT NIGHT
            
            Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring
            Up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations
            To Donkey
            
            SHREK
            And, uh, that one, that's Throwback
            The only ogre to ever spit over three
            Wheat fields
            
            DONKEY
            Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future
            From these stars?
            
            SHREK
            The stars don't tell the future, Donkey
            They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut
            The Flatulent. You can guess what he's
            Famous for
            
            DONKEY
            I know you're making this up
            
            SHREK
            No, look. There he is, and there's the
            Group of hunters running away from his
            Stench
            
            DONKEY
            That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little
            Dots
            
            SHREK
            You know, Donkey, sometimes things are
            More than they appear. Hmm? Forget it
            
            
            DONKEY
            (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what
            We gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?
            
            
            SHREK
            Our swamp?
            
            DONKEY
            You know, when we're through rescuing
            The princess
            
            SHREK
            We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's
            No "our". There's just me and my swamp
            The first thing I'm gonna do is build
            A ten-foot wall around my land
            
            DONKEY
            You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real
            Deep just now. You know what I think?
            I think this whole wall thing is just
            A way to keep somebody out
            
            SHREK
            No, do ya think?
            
            DONKEY
            Are you hidin' something?
            
            SHREK
            Never mind, Donkey
            
            DONKEY
            Oh, this is another one of those onion
            Things, isn't it?
            
            SHREK
            No, this is one of those drop-it and
            Leave-it alone things
            
            DONKEY
            Why don't you want to talk about it?
            
            
            SHREK
            Why do you want to talk about it?
            
            DONKEY
            Why are you blocking?
            
            SHREK
            I'm not blocking
            
            DONKEY
            Oh, yes, you are
            
            SHREK
            Donkey, I'm warning you
            
            DONKEY
            Who you trying to keep out?
            
            SHREK
            Everyone! Okay?
            
            DONKEY
            (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere
            (grins)
            
            At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to
            The cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her
            
            SHREK
            Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and
            Walks over to the edge of the cliff
            And sits down)
            
            DONKEY
            What's your problem? What you got against
            The whole world anyway?
            
            SHREK
            Look, I'm not the one with the problem
            Okay? It's the world that seems to have
            A problem with me. People take one look
            At me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big
            Stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before
            They even know me. That's why I'm better
            Off alone
            
            DONKEY
            You know what? When we met, I didn't
            Think you was just a big, stupid, ugly
            Ogre
            
            SHREK
            Yeah, I know
            
            DONKEY
            So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?
            
            
            SHREK
            Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small
            And Annoying
            
            DONKEY
            Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny
            One, right there. That one there?
            
            
            Fiona puts the door back
            
            SHREK
            That's the moon
            
            DONKEY
            Oh, okay
            
            DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom
            
            The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays
            In the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic
            Mirror shows him Princess Fiona
            
            FARQUAAD
            Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror
            Show her to me. Show me the princess
            
            
            MIRROR
            Hmph
            
            The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning
            
            
            FARQUAAD
            Ah. Perfect
            
            Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up
            To cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly
            At her image in the mirror
            
            MORNING
            
            Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey
            Who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes
            Across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along
            With her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles
            To keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too
            Big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but
            She eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona
            Is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still
            Sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking
            In his sleep
            
            DONKEY
            (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like
            It like that. Come on, baby. I said
            I like it
            
            SHREK
            Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)
            
            DONKEY
            Huh? What?
            
            SHREK
            Wake up
            
            DONKEY
            What? (stretches and yawns)
            
            FIONA
            Good morning. Hm, how do you like your
            Eggs?
            
            DONKEY
            Oh, good morning, Princess!
            
            Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them
            
            SHREK
            What's all this about?
            
            FIONA
            You know, we kind of got off to a bad
            Start yesterday. I wanted to make it
            Up to you. I mean, after all, you did
            Rescue me
            
            SHREK
            Uh, thanks
            
            Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips
            
            FIONA
            Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead
            Of us. (walks off)
            
            LATER
            
            They are once again on their way. They are walking through the
            Forest. Shrek belches
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek!
            
            SHREK
            What? It's a compliment. Better out
            Than in, I always say. (laughs)
            
            DONKEY
            Well, it's no way to behave in front
            Of a princess
            
            Fiona belches
            
            FIONA
            Thanks
            
            DONKEY
            She's as nasty as you are
            
            SHREK
            (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly
            What I expected
            
            FIONA
            Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
            Before you get to know them
            
            She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly
            From out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into
            A tree
            
            ROBIN HOOD
            La liberte! Hey!
            
            SHREK
            Princess!
            
            FIONA
            (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?
            
            
            ROBIN HOOD
            Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior!
            And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses
            Up her arm while Fiona pulls back in
            Disgust)...beast
            
            SHREK
            Hey! That's my princess! Go find you
            Own!
            
            ROBIN HOOD
            Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a
            Little busy here?
            
            FIONA
            (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't
            Know who you think you are!
            
            ROBIN HOOD
            Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please
            Let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men
            (laughs)
            
            Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out
            From the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song
            
            MERRY MEN
            Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo
            
            ROBIN HOOD
            I steal from the rich and give to the
            Needy
            
            MERRY MEN
            He takes a wee percentage
            
            ROBIN HOOD
            But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty
            Damsels, man, I'm good
            
            MERRY MEN
            What a guy, Monsieur Hood
            
            ROBIN HOOD
            Break it down. I like an honest fight
            And a saucy little maid...
            
            MERRY MEN
            What he's basically saying is he likes
            To get...
            
            ROBIN HOOD
            Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush
            Grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad
            
            
            MERRY MEN
            That's bad
            
            ROBIN HOOD
            When a beauty's with a beast it makes
            Me awfully mad
            
            MERRY MEN
            He's mad, he's really, really mad
            
            
            ROBIN HOOD
            I'll take my blade and ram it through
            Your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys
            'cause I'm about to start...
            
            There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and
            Knocks Robin Hood unconscious
            
            FIONA
            Man, that was annoying!
            
            Shrek looks at her in admiration
            
            MERRY MAN
            Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at
            Fiona but she ducks out of the way)
            
            
            The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to
            Get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree
            
            
            Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and
            Then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is
            A very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in
            Mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down
            And Fiona begins walking away
            
            FIONA
            Uh, shall we?
            
            SHREK
            Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins
            Walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa
            Whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come
            From?
            
            FIONA
            What?
            
            SHREK
            That! Back there. That was amazing!
            Where did you learn that?
            
            FIONA
            Well...(laughs) when one lives alone
            Uh, one has to learn these things in
            Case there's a...(gasps and points)
            There's an arrow in your butt!
            
            SHREK
            What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you
            Look at that? (he goes to pull it out
            But flinches because it's tender)
            
            
            FIONA
            Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so
            Sorry
            
            DONKEY
            (walking up) Why? What's wrong?
            
            FIONA
            Shrek's hurt
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no
            Shrek's gonna die
            
            SHREK
            Donkey, I'm okay
            
            DONKEY
            You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm
            Too young for you to die. Keep you legs
            Elevated. Turn your head and cough
            Does anyone know the Heimlich?
            
            FIONA
            Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help
            Shrek, run into the woods and find me
            A blue flower with red thorns
            
            DONKEY
            Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on
            It. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die
            Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay
            Away from the light!
            
            SHREK & FIONA
            Donkey!
            
            DONKEY
            Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns
            (runs off)
            
            SHREK
            What are the flowers for?
            
            FIONA
            (like it's obvious) For getting rid
            Of Donkey
            
            SHREK
            Ah
            
            FIONA
            Now you hold still, and I'll yank this
            Thing out. (gives the arrow a little
            Pull)
            
            SHREK
            (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the
            Yankin'
            
            As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and
            Shrek keeps dodging her hands
            
            FIONA
            I'm sorry, but it has to come out
            
            
            SHREK
            No, it's tender
            
            FIONA
            Now, hold on
            
            SHREK
            What you're doing is the opposite of
            Help
            
            FIONA
            Don't move
            
            SHREK
            Look, time out
            
            FIONA
            Would you...(grunts as Shrek puts his
            Hand over her face to stop her from
            Getting at the arrow) Okay. What do
            You propose we do?
            
            ELSEWHERE
            
            Donkey is still looking for the special flower
            
            DONKEY
            Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower
            Red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns
            This would be so much easier if I wasn't
            Color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns
            
            
            SHREK
            (os) Ow!
            
            DONKEY
            Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! (rips a
            Flower off a nearby bush that just happens
            To be a blue flower with red thorns)
            
            
            THE FOREST PATH
            
            SHREK
            Ow! Not good
            
            FIONA
            Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head
            (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just
            About...
            
            SHREK
            Ow! Ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall
            Over with Fiona on top of him)
            
            DONKEY
            Ahem
            
            SHREK
            (throwing Fiona off of him) Nothing
            Happend. We were just, uh - -
            
            DONKEY
            Look, if you wanted to be alone, all
            You had to do was ask. Okay?
            
            SHREK
            Oh, come on! That's the last thing on
            My mind. The princess here was just-
            - (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he
            Turns to look at Fiona who holds up
            The arrow with a smile) Ow!
            
            DONKEY
            Hey, what's that? (nervous chuckle)
            That's...is that blood?
            
            Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue
            On their way
            
            There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc
            Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a
            Small brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as
            Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back
            Into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting
            And a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb
            That's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it
            Around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins
            Eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers
            Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting
            It to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning
            It into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group
            Arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc
            
            WINDMILL
            
            SHREK
            There it is, Princess. Your future awaits
            You
            
            FIONA
            That's DuLoc?
            
            DONKEY
            Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks
            Lord Farquaad's compensating for something
            Which I think means he has a really...(Shrek
            Steps on his hoof) Ow!
            
            SHREK
            Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move
            On
            
            FIONA
            Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried
            About Donkey
            
            SHREK
            What?
            
            FIONA
            I mean, look at him. He doesn't look
            So good
            
            DONKEY
            What are you talking about? I'm fine
            
            
            FIONA
            (kneels to look him in the eyes) That's
            What they always say, and then next
            Thing you know, you're on your back
            (pause) Dead
            
            SHREK
            You know, she's right. You look awful
            Do you want to sit down?
            
            FIONA
            Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea
            
            
            DONKEY
            I didn't want to say nothin', but I
            Got this twinge in my neck, and when
            I turn my head like this, look, (turns
            His neck in a very sharp way until his
            Head is completely sideways) Ow! See?
            
            
            SHREK
            Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner
            
            
            FIONA
            I'll get the firewood
            
            DONKEY
            Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't
            Feel my toes! (looks down and yelps)
            I don't have any toes! I think I need
            A hug
            
            SUNSET
            
            Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while
            Fiona eats
            
            FIONA
            Mmm. This is good. This is really good
            What is this?
            
            SHREK
            Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style
            
            FIONA
            No kidding. Well, this is delicious
            
            
            SHREK
            Well, they're also great in stews. Now
            I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean
            Weed rat stew. (chuckles)
            
            Fiona looks at DuLoc and sighs
            
            FIONA
            I guess I'll be dining a little differently
            Tomorrow night
            
            SHREK
            Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp
            Sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff
            For you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare
            - - you name it
            
            FIONA
            (smiles) I'd like that
            
            They smiles at each other
            
            SHREK
            Um, Princess?
            
            FIONA
            Yes, Shrek?
            
            SHREK
            I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs)
            Are you gonna eat that?
            
            DONKEY
            (chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic?
            Just look at that sunset
            
            FIONA
            (jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's
            Late. I-It's very late
            
            SHREK
            What?
            
            DONKEY
            Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on
            Here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't
            You?
            
            FIONA
            Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified
            You know, I'd better go inside
            
            DONKEY
            Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to
            Be afraid of the dark, too, until -
            - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of
            The dark
            
            Shrek sighs
            
            FIONA
            Good night
            
            SHREK
            Good night
            
            Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks
            At Shrek with a new eye
            
            DONKEY
            Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on
            Here
            
            SHREK
            Oh, what are you talkin' about?
            
            DONKEY
            I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm
            An animal, and I got instincts. And
            I know you two were diggin' on each
            Other. I could feel it
            
            SHREK
            You're crazy. I'm just bringing her
            Back to Farquaad
            
            DONKEY
            Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell
            The pheromones. Just go on in and tell
            Her how you feel
            
            SHREK
            I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides
            Even if I did tell her that, well, you
            Know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause
            I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm
            - -
            
            DONKEY
            An ogre?
            
            SHREK
            Yeah. An ogre
            
            DONKEY
            Hey, where you goin'?
            
            SHREK
            To get... move firewood. (sighs)
            
            Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already
            Is
            
            TIME LAPSE
            
            Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is
            Nowhere to be seen
            
            DONKEY
            Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess
            Where are you? Princess?
            
            Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her
            
            
            DONKEY
            It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing
            No games
            
            Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn't
            Look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking
            Out
            
            DONKEY
            Aah!
            
            FIONA
            Oh, no!
            
            DONKEY
            No, help!
            
            FIONA
            Shh!
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
            
            FIONA
            No, it's okay. It's okay
            
            DONKEY
            What did you do with the princess?
            
            
            FIONA
            Donkey, I'm the princess
            
            DONKEY
            Aah!
            
            FIONA
            It's me, in this body
            
            DONKEY
            Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to
            Her stomach) Can you hear me?
            
            FIONA
            Donkey!
            
            DONKEY
            (still aimed at her stomach) Listen
            Keep breathing! I'll get you out of
            There!
            
            FIONA
            No!
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
            
            FIONA
            Shh
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek!
            
            FIONA
            This is me
            
            Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets
            Down
            
            DONKEY
            Princess? What happened to you? You're
            Uh, uh, uh, different
            
            FIONA
            I'm ugly, okay?
            
            DONKEY
            Well, yeah! Was it something you ate?
            'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a
            Bad idea. You are what you eat, I said
            Now - -
            
            FIONA
            No. I - - I've been this way as long
            As I can remember
            
            DONKEY
            What do you mean? Look, I ain't never
            Seen you like this before
            
            FIONA
            It only happens when sun goes down
            "By night one way, by day another. This
            Shall be the norm... until you find
            True love's first kiss... and then take
            Love's true form."
            
            DONKEY
            Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know
            You wrote poetry
            
            FIONA
            It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little
            Girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every
            Night I become this. This horrible
            Ugly beast! I was placed in a tower
            To await the day my true love would
            Rescue me. That's why I have to marry
            Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun
            Sets and he sees me like this. (begins
            To cry)
            
            DONKEY
            All right, all right. Calm down. Look
            It's not that bad. You're not that ugly
            Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly
            But you only look like this at night
            Shrek's ugly 24-7
            
            FIONA
            But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this
            Is not how a princess is meant to look
            
            
            DONKEY
            Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry
            Farquaad?
            
            FIONA
            I have to. Only my true love's kiss
            Can break the spell
            
            DONKEY
            But, you know, um, you're kind of an
            Orge, and Shrek - - well, you got a
            Lot in common
            
            FIONA
            Shrek?
            
            OUTSIDE
            
            Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his
            Hand
            
            SHREK
            (to himself) Princess, I - - Uh, how's
            It going, first of all? Good? Um, good
            For me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower
            And thought of you because it's pretty
            And - - well, I don't really like it
            But I thought you might like it 'cause
            You're pretty. But I like you anyway
            I'd - - uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble
            Okay, here we go
            
            He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey
            And Fiona talking
            
            FIONA
            (os) I can't just marry whoever I want
            Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean
            Really, who can ever love a beast so
            Hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly"
            Don't go together. That's why I can't
            Stay here with Shrek
            
            Shrek steps back in shock
            
            FIONA
            (os) My only chance to live happily
            Ever after is to marry my true love
            
            
            Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks
            Away
            
            INSIDE
            
            FIONA
            Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how
            It has to be. It's the only way to break
            The spell
            
            DONKEY
            You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth
            
            
            FIONA
            No! You can't breathe a word. No one
            Must ever know
            
            DONKEY
            What's the point of being able to talk
            If you gotta keep secrets?
            
            FIONA
            Promise you won't tell. Promise!
            
            DONKEY
            All right, all right. I won't tell him
            But you should. (goes outside) I just
            Know before this is over, I'm gonna
            Need a whole lot of serious therapy
            Look at my eye twitchin'
            
            Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks
            Down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back
            Inside the windmill
            
            MORNING
            
            Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still
            Awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower
            
            FIONA
            I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him
            I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly
            Runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek!
            Shrek, there's something I want...(she
            Looks and sees the rising sun, and as
            The sun crests the sky she turns back
            Into a human.)
            
            Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards
            Her
            
            FIONA
            Shrek. Are you all right?
            
            SHREK
            Perfect! Never been better
            
            FIONA
            I - - I don't - - There's something
            I have to tell you
            
            SHREK
            You don't have to tell me anything
            Princess. I heard enough last night
            
            
            FIONA
            You heard what I said?
            
            SHREK
            Every word
            
            FIONA
            I thought you'd understand
            
            SHREK
            Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who
            Could love a hideous, ugly beast?"
            
            
            FIONA
            But I thought that wouldn't matter to
            You
            
            SHREK
            Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at
            Him in shock. He looks past her and
            Spots a group approaching.) Ah, right
            On time. Princess, I've brought you
            A little something
            
            Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal
            Sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only
            Like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers
            March by
            
            DONKEY
            What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots
            The soldiers) (muffled) Who said that?
            Couldn't have been the donkey
            
            FARQUAAD
            Princess Fiona
            
            SHREK
            As promised. Now hand it over
            
            FARQUAAD
            Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece
            Of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared
            Out, as agreed. Take it and go before
            I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper)
            Forgive me, Princess, for startling
            You, but you startled me, for I have
            Never seen such a radiant beauty before
            I'm Lord Farquaad
            
            FIONA
            Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad
            Snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord
            For I was just saying a short... (Watches
            As Farquaad is lifted off his horse
            And set down in front of her. He comes
            To her waist.) farewell
            
            FARQUAAD
            Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have
            To waste good manners on the ogre. It's
            Not like it has feelings
            
            FIONA
            No, you're right. It doesn't
            
            Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face
            
            
            FARQUAAD
            Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless
            Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage
            Will you be the perfect bride for the
            Perfect groom?
            
            FIONA
            Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would
            Make - -
            
            FARQUAAD
            (interrupting) Excellent! I'll start
            The plans, for tomorrow we wed!
            
            FIONA
            No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get
            Married today before the sun sets
            
            
            FARQUAAD
            Oh, anxious, are you? You're right
            The sooner, the better. There's so much
            To do! There's the caterer, the cake
            The band, the guest list. Captain, round
            Up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona
            On the back of his horse)
            
            FIONA
            Fare-thee-well, ogre
            
            Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches
            Them go
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting
            Her get away
            
            SHREK
            Yeah? So what?
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek, there's something about her you
            Don't know. Look, I talked to her last
            Night, She's - -
            
            SHREK
            I know you talked to her last night
            You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if
            You two are such good friends, why don't
            You follow her home?
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you
            
            SHREK
            I told you, didn't I? You're not coming
            Home with me. I live alone! My swamp!
            Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody!
            Especially useless, pathetic, annoying
            Talking donkeys!
            
            DONKEY
            But I thought - -
            
            SHREK
            Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong!
            (stomps off)
            
            DONKEY
            Shrek
            
            Montage of different scenes. Shrek arriving back home. Fiona
            Being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running
            Into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner
            Alone. Shrek eating dinner alone
            
            SHREK'S HOME
            
            Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes
            Outside to investigate
            
            SHREK
            Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues
            With what he's doing.) What are you
            Doing?
            
            DONKEY
            I would think, of all people, you would
            Recognize a wall when you see one
            
            
            SHREK
            Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed
            To go around my swamp, not through it
            
            
            DONKEY
            It is around your half. See that's your
            Half, and this is my half
            
            SHREK
            Oh! Your half. Hmm
            
            DONKEY
            Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess
            I did half the work. I get half the
            Booty. Now hand me that big old rock
            The one that looks like your head
            
            
            SHREK
            Back off!
            
            DONKEY
            No, you back off
            
            SHREK
            This is my swamp!
            
            DONKEY
            Our swamp
            
            SHREK
            (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working
            With) Let go, Donkey!
            
            DONKEY
            You let go
            
            SHREK
            Stubborn jackass!
            
            DONKEY
            Smelly ogre
            
            SHREK
            Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks
            Away)
            
            DONKEY
            Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through
            With you yet
            
            SHREK
            Well, I'm through with you
            
            DONKEY
            Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always
            "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now
            It's my turn! So you just shut up and
            Pay attention! You are mean to me. You
            Insult me and you don't appreciate anything
            That I do! You're always pushing me
            Around or pushing me away
            
            SHREK
            Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so
            Bad, how come you came back?
            
            DONKEY
            Because that's what friends do! They
            Forgive each other!
            
            SHREK
            Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive
            You... for stabbin' me in the back!
            (goes into the outhouse and slams the
            Door)
            
            DONKEY
            Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers
            Onion boy, you're afraid of your own
            Feelings
            
            SHREK
            (os) Go away!
            
            DONKEY
            There you are , doing it again just
            Like you did to Fiona. All she ever
            Do was like you, maybe even love you
            
            
            SHREK
            (os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a
            Hideous creature. I heard the two of
            You talking
            
            DONKEY
            She wasn't talkin' about you. She was
            Talkin' about, uh, somebody else
            
            
            SHREK
            (opens the door and comes out) She wasn't
            Talking about me? Well, then who was
            She talking about?
            
            DONKEY
            Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything
            You don't wanna listen to me. Right?
            Right?
            
            SHREK
            Donkey!
            
            DONKEY
            No!
            
            SHREK
            Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh)
            I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big
            Stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?
            
            
            DONKEY
            Hey, that's what friends are for, right?
            
            
            SHREK
            Right. Friends?
            
            DONKEY
            Friends
            
            SHREK
            So, um, what did Fiona say about me?
            
            
            DONKEY
            What are you asking me for? Why don't
            You just go ask her?
            
            SHREK
            The wedding! We'll never make it in
            Time
            
            DONKEY
            Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's
            A will, there's a way and I have a way
            (whistles)
            
            Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so
            They can climb on
            
            SHREK
            Donkey?
            
            DONKEY
            I guess it's just my animal magnetism
            
            
            They both laugh
            
            SHREK
            Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a
            Noogie)
            
            DONKEY
            All right, all right. Don't get all
            Slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All
            Right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't
            Had a chance to install the seat belts
            Yet
            
            They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for DuLoc
            
            DULOC - CHURCH
            
            Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there
            The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'
            
            
            PRIEST
            People of DuLoc, we gather here today
            To bear witness to the union....
            
            FIONA
            (eyeing the setting sun) Um-
            
            PRIEST
            ...of our new king...
            
            FIONA
            Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead
            To the "I do's"?
            
            FARQUAAD
            (chuckles and then motions to the priest
            To indulge Fiona) Go on
            
            COURTYARD
            
            Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with
            A boom. The guards all take off running
            
            DONKEY
            (to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN
            If we need you, I'll whistle. How about
            That? (she nods and goes after the guards)
            Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You
            Wanna do this right, don't you?
            
            SHREK
            (at the Church door) What are you talking
            About?
            
            DONKEY
            There's a line you gotta wait for. The
            Preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or
            Forever hold your peace." That's when
            You say, "I object!"
            
            SHREK
            I don't have time for this!
            
            DONKEY
            Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen
            To me! Look, you love this woman, don't
            You?
            
            SHREK
            Yes
            
            DONKEY
            You wanna hold her?
            
            SHREK
            Yes
            
            DONKEY
            Please her?
            
            SHREK
            Yes!
            
            DONKEY
            (singing James Brown style) Then you
            Got to, got to try a little tenderness
            (normal) The chicks love that romantic
            Crap!
            
            SHREK
            All right! Cut it out. When does this
            Guy say the line?
            
            DONKEY
            We gotta check it out
            
            INSIDE CHURCH
            
            As the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the
            Windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see
            
            PRIEST
            And so, by the power vested in me...
            
            
            Outside
            
            SHREK
            What do you see?
            
            DONKEY
            The whole town's in there
            
            Inside
            
            PRIEST
            I now pronounce you husband and wife...
            
            
            Outside
            
            DONKEY
            They're at the altar
            
            Inside
            
            PRIEST
            ...king and queen
            
            Outside
            
            DONKEY
            Mother Fletcher! He already said it
            
            
            SHREK
            Oh, for the love of Pete!
            
            He runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard
            
            
            INSIDE CHURCH
            
            SHREK
            (running toward the alter) I object!
            
            
            FIONA
            Shrek?
            
            The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek
            
            FARQUAAD
            Oh, now what does he want?
            
            SHREK
            (to congregation as he reaches the front
            Of the Church) Hi, everyone. Havin'
            A good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first
            Of all. Very clean
            
            FIONA
            What are you doing here?
            
            SHREK
            Really, it's rude enough being alive
            When no one wants you, but showing up
            Uninvited to a wedding...
            
            SHREK
            Fiona! I need to talk to you
            
            FIONA
            Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little
            Late for that, so if you'll excuse me
            - -
            
            SHREK
            But you can't marry him
            
            FIONA
            And why not?
            
            SHREK
            Because- - Because he's just marring
            You so he can be king
            
            FARQUAAD
            Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him
            
            
            SHREK
            He's not your true love
            
            FIONA
            And what do you know about true love?
            
            
            SHREK
            Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -
            
            FARQUAAD
            Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen
            In love with the princess! Oh, good
            Lord. (laughs)
            
            The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The
            Whole congregation laughs
            
            FARQUAAD
            An ogre and a princess!
            
            FIONA
            Shrek, is this true?
            
            FARQUAAD
            Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona
            My love, we're but a kiss away from
            Our "happily ever after." Now kiss me!
            (puckers his lips and leans toward her
            But she pulls back.)
            
            FIONA
            (looking at the setting sun) "By night
            One way, by day another." (to Shrek)
            I wanted to show you before
            
            She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self
            She gives Shrek a sheepish smile
            
            SHREK
            Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona
            Smiles)
            
            FARQUAAD
            Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards!
            I order you to get that out of my sight
            Now! Get them! Get them both!
            
            The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights
            Them
            
            SHREK
            No, no!
            
            FIONA
            Shrek!
            
            FARQUAAD
            This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This
            Marriage is binding, and that makes
            Me king! See? See?
            
            FIONA
            No, let go of me! Shrek!
            
            SHREK
            No!
            
            FARQUAAD
            Don't just stand there, you morons
            
            
            SHREK
            Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!
            
            FARQUAAD
            I'll make you regret the day we met
            I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll
            Beg for death to save you!
            
            FIONA
            No, Shrek!
            
            FARQUAAD
            (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And
            As for you, my wife...
            
            SHREK
            Fiona!
            
            FARQUAAD
            I'll have you locked back in that tower
            For the rest of your days! I'm king!
            
            
            Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles
            
            FARQUAAD
            I will have order! I will have perfection!
            I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon
            Show up and the dragon leans down and
            Eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!
            
            DONKEY
            All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon
            Here, and I'm not afraid to use it
            (The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on
            The edge!
            
            The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth
            And falls to the ground
            
            DONKEY
            Celebrity marriages. They never last
            Do they?
            
            The congregation cheers
            
            DONKEY
            Go ahead, Shrek
            
            SHREK
            Uh, Fiona?
            
            FIONA
            Yes, Shrek?
            
            SHREK
            I - - I love you
            
            FIONA
            Really?
            
            SHREK
            Really, really
            
            FIONA
            (smiles) I love you too
            
            Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes
            'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation
            
            
            CONGREGATION
            Aawww!
            
            Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted
            Up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around
            Her
            
            WHISPERS
            "Until you find true love's first kiss
            And then take love's true form. Take
            Love's true form. Take love's true form."
            
            
            Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell
            And then is slowly lowered to the ground
            
            SHREK
            (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are
            You all right?
            
            FIONA
            (standing up, she's still an ogre) Well
            Yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed
            To be beautiful
            
            SHREK
            But you ARE beautiful
            
            They smile at each other
            
            DONKEY
            (chuckles) I was hoping this would be
            A happy ending
            
            Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...
            
            THE SWAMP
            
            ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm
            A Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek
            And Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting
            Carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet
            Which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end
            Up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet
            Instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now
            Has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona
            Walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over
            Singing the song
            
            GINGERBREAD MAN
            God bless us, every one
            
            DONKEY
            (as he's done singing and we fade to
            Black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't
            Breathe. I can't breathe
            
            THE END
